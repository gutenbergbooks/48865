<h2>FOREWORD<span class="pb" id="Pgv">[v]</span></h2>

<p>The importance of the subject treated in this study,
as well as the prominent part played by the Australian
evidence in the problem of kinship, will, it is believed,
amply justify a detailed inquiry into the institution of
the family in Australia. It is, however, always desirable
for a monograph like the present one, besides being a
mere collection and description of facts, to have a sufficiently
wide theoretical scope. It ought to demonstrate
some general principle upon the particular example
treated, and to approach the problem from a new standpoint.</p>

<p>I wish here shortly to indicate how far a slight and
imperfect attempt in this direction has been made. In
describing the facts of family life in Australia I have
tried to show that even if the problems of origins and
development of an institution be put aside and the
inquiry be limited to the actual facts (in this case to the
actual working of the aboriginal kinship organization),
there are plenty of subjects of great theoretical importance,
some of which, as yet not fully considered by
sociologists. On the other hand, I have tried to show that
in dealing with purely sociological problems it is necessary,
in order to do justice to the complexity and fulness of
social phenomena, to draw into the field of inquiry a
series of facts often hitherto partially or completely
neglected. The facts of daily life, the emotional side
of family relations, the magico-religious ideas of the
aborigines about kinship and sexual relations, customary
as well as legal norms&mdash;all these factors must be taken
impartially into careful consideration in order to give the
full picture of an institution as it embraces living man in
<span class="pb" id="Pgvi">[vi]</span>
a living society. In other words each social institution
must be studied in all its complex social functions as
well as in its reflexion in the collective psychology.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, by a certain tendency to fanciful
construction, natural in all early speculations about a
new domain of facts, many problems in the study of
primitive kinship have been artificially simplified, others
unduly complicated and obscured. Thus, for instance,
when in the discussion of primitive forms of marriage the
whole problem of the position of the children and of the
emotional attitude of the parents towards them has been
neglected; or when different legal terms have been applied
to undifferentiated societies and legal ideas attributed to
primitive man, without asking how far and under what
conditions this may be done; or, again, when the sexual
aspect has been treated as the only essential feature of
marriage. On the other hand, the concepts of "primitive
promiscuity," "descent through females only," "mother-right"
and "father-right" have proved meaningless and
abstruse; the two latter, of course, as far only as they
have been used in the majority of cases without a satisfactory
definition.</p>

<p>It is easy to see why such somewhat artificial conceptions
have found their way into the study of primitive
marriage and kinship. In the early days of these studies
work had been done not by specialists, who would try to
apply to a new set of problems new methods, but by men
learned in other branches of science, who looked at the
facts, not full in the face, but from a peculiar and often
remote standpoint. The illustrious founder of these
studies on the Continent, the Swiss <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i> Bachofen,
was a student of history of law and classical culture,
and he was chiefly concerned with establishing the
primitive mother-right of the prehistoric Greeks and
Romans. The chief theoretical interest of the eminent
ethnographer Morgan was the unravelling of the riddle
of primitive forms of marriage out of the invaluable
material contained in his tables of kinship terms.
<span class="pb" id="Pgvii">[vii]</span>
McLennan assigns a prominent place in his investigations
to factors which had hardly ever played a very important
part in primitive society, as, for instance, marriage by
capture, female infanticide and levirate. It is evident
that in all these and similar speculations the chief attention
was not drawn to the actual working of the social
mechanism, but to survivals, rudiments and fictitious
primeval conditions. And the method of sociological
thinking has not been developed upon living social
forms, but upon shadows and petrified remains. Whenever
concrete institutions have been theoretically treated,
they were approached with preconceived ideas, as, for
instance, in the well-known monograph of Fison and
Howitt, and in the book of Herr H. Cunow&mdash;both
works relating to Australian kinship organization. When
reading the theoretical chapters of the latter, one has
the impression that the Australian tribes were a museum
of sociological fossils from various ancient epochs of
which the petrified form has been rigidly preserved, but
into whose inner nature it is quite hopeless to inquire.
The understanding of actual facts is sacrificed to sterile
speculation upon a hypothetical earlier state of things.</p>

<p>Prof. Tylor's well-known article (<cite>Journ. Anthrop.
Inst.</cite> xviii.) was, perhaps, the first protest against
this loose and far-fetched treatment of the subject.
He based his method of research on the firm ground of
a statistical survey of facts, and his method of reasoning
on the philosophically sound principle of inquiring into
the mutual dependence of phenomena.</p>

<p>The whole problem has been set on a new basis and its
treatment recast in the fundamental treatise of Prof.
Westermarck on the <cite>History of Human Marriage</cite>. Several
of the most important aspects of the question which had
been omitted in the speculations of the previous writers
have received in it their full treatment; in taking into
account, in its manifold aspects, the biological basis of
the problem he has shown how many of the current conceptions
about primitive marriage and kinship could not
<span class="pb" id="Pgviii">[viii]</span>
hold good in the light of a closer criticism. Besides this
merely critical contribution, and besides the biological
argument, the <cite>History of Human Marriage</cite> constitutes a
valuable addition to the purely sociological treatment of
the problem. By resolving the problem of marriage into
that of family, by pointing to the importance of the
relations between parents and children, of the mode of
living, etc., the author has shown that marriage is rooted
in a complex of sociological conditions, and that there
are many points to be treated before we arrive at definite
conclusions and broad generalizations.</p>

<p>Another important aspect of the problem has received
its full treatment by Mr. Crawley in his study of primitive
marriage (the <cite>Mystic Rose</cite>; compare the note in
the Addenda at the end of this volume). Working
out thoroughly some conceptions suggested already by
Prof. Frazer in his <cite>Golden Bough</cite>, the author has shown
the social importance of the ideas about human relations
and in particular about sexual relations as held by
primitive man.</p>

<p>The tendency towards a reform in the method of
sociological treatment of kinship and family has been
shown not only from the side of purely theoretical writers.
Some of the modern field workers, who happily for our
science are at the same time distinguished scholars, have
achieved a considerable advance in the method of collecting
evidence. This refers in the first place to the Cambridge
School of Ethnology, whose members under the
lead of Dr. Haddon have obtained such remarkable
results from their work in the Torres Straits Islands.
Dr. Rivers, who specially worked out the chapter on
kinship in the joint publication of this Expedition, has, by
the introduction of the genealogical method of inquiry as
well as by the systematic study of the functions of kin,
given perhaps the most useful instruments of inquiry
into the social working of family and kinship organization.
Thus both our theoretical conceptions and our methods
of getting at the facts are certainly approaching more and
<span class="pb" id="Pgix">[ix]</span>
more the first postulate of scientific study: the possibility
of an adequate description of facts and their mutual
dependences as they exist now in living primitive societies.
Only on a basis of such knowledge are further speculations
fruitful.</p>

<p>As regards the general principles of sociological method
much has been done in recent times by the French school
of sociology, grouped round the editor of the <cite>Année
Sociologique</cite>. The important question, how methodically
to present evidence, has received its full attention in the
excellent works of Dr. Steinmetz and his pupil, Dr. Nieboer,
which are examples of a clear and conclusive way of
utilizing ethnological sources. I am glad to acknowledge
my intellectual indebtedness to both these schools.</p>

<p>I have tried to collect sufficiently complete evidence,
and in this endeavour have used some of the older sources
whose trustworthiness might perhaps be disputed. But
many of their observations are highly valuable if properly
interpreted; and moreover it was necessary to bring
their statements into line with the newer evidence for the
sake of critical comparison, as much of what they say has
been uncritically accepted and given without reference
by some secondhand compilers (for instance, Waitz-Gerland,
vol. vi.; Cunow) and hence found its way into
the newer sociological literature.</p>

<p>The statements I have taken from the different authors
are quoted at length, and I do not think that I have thus
uselessly increased the bulk of the volume. By an
unprejudiced collection of evidence, which is, moreover,
presented in a manner independent of, and accessible
without reference to, the theoretical discussion, I hope to
have given a useful compilation of observations which
may serve for further theoretical purposes other than
those of the present writer.</p>

<p>In order to make short and yet clear references possible
a list of the works quoted is given at the end. With its
help the short indications in the footnotes will be perfectly
plain.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pgx">[x]</span>
In this place I wish to express my deep gratitude to
Mr. J. Martin White, whose munificence has made the
publication of this book possible. As a student of
sociology at the University of London I am indebted to
Mr. Martin White, who, as it is well known, has founded
the chairs of Sociology at this university, and furthers
these studies in various ways&mdash;not the least by his
personal contact with and interest shown in the students
and their work.</p>

<p>I had, while working on the present book, the privilege
of personal intercourse with Prof. Westermarck, a privilege
I value more than I can express. I owe much to Dr.
Rivers for the constant aid and counsel generously given
me during my studies. Much assistance was given to
me by Mr. Wheeler, who freely put at my disposal his
extensive knowledge of the subject. I have to thank
Dr. Tallqvist for several important remarks upon some
pages of my proofs.</p>

<p>But my debt is the greatest to Miss Helena Hadley,
without whose kind help I could not have overcome
the difficulties of writing in what is for me an acquired
tongue. Her advice and criticism, both as regards style
and thought, were quite invaluable for me, and this is
only a feeble acknowledgment of my indebtedness and
feelings of gratitude.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>EXPOSITION OF THE PROBLEM AND METHOD</small></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The problem of the social forms of family life still
presents some obscurities. What appears to be most
urgently needed is a careful investigation of facts in all
the different ethnographical areas. I propose in this
study to undertake this task for Australia. I shall avoid
making any hypothetical assumptions, or discussing
general problems which refer to the origin or evolution
of the family. I wish only to describe in correct terms
and as thoroughly as possible all that refers to actual
family life in Australia. In other words I intend to give
in outline the social morphology of the Australian family.</p>

<p>It may be well to show briefly the necessity for this
task, which to some may appear superfluous, and to
indicate the lines on which it will be attempted. In the
first place there are some contradictions with regard to
the problem of relationship or kinship in Australia, which
can be reduced to the question: Is kinship in Australia
exclusively individual; or is it exclusively group kinship
(or tribal kinship, as it often is called); and, further, do
these two forms exclude each other or do they perhaps
exist side by side? When Howitt says: "The social
unit is not the individual, but the group; the former
<span class="pb" id="Pg2">[2]</span>
merely takes the relationships of his group, which are of
group to group,"<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tribes, p. 157. It is hardly necessary to point out that this phrase is without a precise sense, unless it be evident in what sense the author uses the conception 'social unit.' One looks in vain for such a definition in Howitt.">[1]</a> this obviously means that there is
no individual relationship, consequently no individual
family in Australia. It is important to note that the
passage just quoted is placed in the chapter on Relationship
in Howitt's chief work on Australia, and that consequently
it refers to all the tribes described by the author,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> to the majority of the known Australian tribes.
The same opinion that there is only group relationship
and no individual family is supported by another passage,
no less important and general, for it is placed at the conclusion
of Howitt's article on the organization of the
Australian tribes in general: "It has been shown that
the fundamental idea in the conception of an Australian
community is its division into two groups. The relationships
which obtain between the members of them are also
those of group to group."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Trans. R.S.V., l.c., p. 134.">[2]</a> And again: "The unit of
aboriginal society is, therefore, not the individual, but
the group. It is the group which marries the group and
which begets the group."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Trans. R.S.V., p. 135.">[3]</a> There are also a few passages
in Spencer and Gillen which deny the existence of the
individual family, at least in some tribes.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Compare the passage quoted by A. Lang, just below, and the passage quoted by us, pp. 108 sqq., and p. 243. How far Spencer and Gillen have the right to deny the existence of the individual family among the Urabunna will be discussed in detail below.">[4]</a></p>

<p>Thus the impression drawn from the passages just
quoted<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="I have quoted the best first-hand authorities; instances could easily be multiplied as well from their works as also from other sources.">[5]</a> is that there is no individual relationship and,
what follows as an immediate consequence, no individual
marriage, nor individual family in Australia. Such a
conclusion would be absolutely false. For the same
author (Howitt) writes: "Individual marriage in Australian
<span class="pb" id="Pg3">[3]</span>
tribes has been evident to everyone."<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor" title="Trans. R.S.V., p. 115.">[6]</a> Curr speaks
in still more positive terms: "No relationship but that
of blood is known amongst Australians."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, A.R., i. p. iii.">[7]</a> The social
relations which exist amongst the Australian aborigines
are of five sorts; first, those of family; second, those of
the tribe; third, those between associated tribes; fourth,
those of neighbours who belong to different associations;
fifth, all other persons.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, A.R., i. p. 60.">[8]</a> We see that in Curr's statements
there is again no room for any kind of group relationship.
Obviously Curr's information contradicts in plain terms
the foregoing set of statements, and such a contradiction
among our best informants is truly puzzling. There
seems to be some misunderstanding in the present
problem.</p>

<p>This is not only my own opinion. Mr. A. Lang discusses
the same question and finds it necessary to prove
in a short article that individual relationship exists in
Australia. He says: "It is certain that 'blood' or
'own' relations are perfectly recognized. Messrs. Spencer
and Gillen inadvertently deny this, saying: 'The savage
Australian, it may be said with truth, has no idea of
relationships as we understand them.'" This example
is not the only one, as has been shown above, and indeed
their number could be easily multiplied. Mr. Lang proves
by several instances that this opinion of Spencer and Gillen
is erroneous, and concludes: "The savage Australian
does discriminate between his actual and his tribal relations.
It was necessary to make this fact clear and
certain, as it has been denied."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Procs. B. Academy, vol. iii. 1908, May report, p. 4.">[9]</a> The same contradiction
has also been pointed out by Dr. Westermarck: "As to
the South Australians, Mr. Fison's statements have caused
not a little confusion. On his authority several writers
assert that among the Australian savages groups of males
are actually found united to groups of females."<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Westermarck Ed. The History of Human Marriage, p. 56.">[10]</a> And
<span class="pb" id="Pg4">[4]</span>
in a footnote Dr. Westermarck quotes Lubbock, Morgan,
Kohler, Kovalevsky. With such views Dr. Westermarck
contrasts Curr's<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, A.R., i. p. 126.">[11]</a> opinion that strict monogamy obtains,
and that of the Rev. J. Mathew,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor" title="Mathew, J.R.S.N.S.W., xxiii. p. 404, quoted from Westermarck, H.H.M., p. 57.">[12]</a> "who fails to see that
group marriage 'has been proven to exist in the past and
certainly does not occur in Australia now.'"</p>

<p>Again E. Grosse in his well-known book, speaking of
Howitt's work on the Kurnai says that this author
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"... hat sich so gründlich in seine Hypothese einer
Gruppenehe ... der prähistorischen Australier vertieft,
dass er darüber ganz vergisst, seine Leser darauf aufmerksam
zu machen, dass die historischen Australier in Einzelnehe
leben."</span><a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor" title="E. Grosse, p. 6.">[13]</a> This is quite true, especially the remark
that one of the chief sources of error in sociology is speculating
on the origins and prehistory of an institution
before this institution is thoroughly known in the present
state.</p>

<p>And it seems as if in the present case a good many of
the difficulties may be solved by understanding some of
the statements made as referring to hypothetical earlier
stages. As a matter of fact the passage quoted above,
where the existence of group relationship is affirmed, is
continued thus: "The idea of the relation of individual
to individual, and of individual parentage, without
reference to the group, is of later origin, and is the result
of a number of social forces acting in the same general
direction and producing change."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Trans. R.S.V., p. 135.">[14]</a> It is evident therefore
that group relationship is supposed by Howitt to be
the former state, and individual relationship a kind of
innovation. But there is such a lack of clearness, such a
confusion of the past and present tenses, that we are here
again at a loss. Take for example the following passage:
"The latest advance which has been made in the subject
of Australian marriage was the conception of marriage in
the group, and of group to group, and of the filial relation
<span class="pb" id="Pg5">[5]</span>
of one group to another."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Trans. R.S.V., p. 113.">[15]</a> This last phrase should be,
in all probability, understood in the past tense, as referring
to prehistoric times. But the author gives absolutely no
hint whether this be so or otherwise. And when he on
the next page refers to Mr. Curr's assertion, that there is
actually no group relationship in Australia, and criticizes
this assertion, a suspicion is aroused that this view of the
existence of marital and filial groups is meant to express
the actual status. This is enough to show how vague and
puzzling the question of the individual family and individual
relationship still is.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to insist on the bewilderment, but
the polemical mood in which our informants always
approached the problem of relationship and family has
had its unfortunate consequences. In the first place it is
easy to see that these two groups of facts&mdash;individual relationship
and group relationship&mdash;are treated by the writers
as if they excluded each other, or at least as if one of them
were gradually encroaching upon the other. Whereas
it is quite possible that both individual and group relationship
might exist side by side, originating from different
sources, and expressing two different sets of social relationships.
In the second place, the polemical attitude of our
best informants (Howitt, and Spencer and Gillen) against
individual relationship resulted in their giving very
meagre information about the individual family. As a
matter of fact, in all theoretical passages of works devoted
to the social organization of the Australian tribes, the
individual family is passed over in absolute silence.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="As e. g. in the general treatises of Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., Nor. Tr., Howitt's Nat. Tr., Howitt and Fison, K.K. Idem in J.A.J., xii. p. 33. Howitt in Trans. R.S.V., p. 100, and in Smithsonian Reports, p. 79.">[16]</a> As
this unit obviously plays a foremost part in the social
life of Australian tribes, I submit it is quite justifiable that
in these pages some information about this unit should
be gathered and its importance brought out. Special
attention has been devoted to the facts of actual family life.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg6">[6]</span>
To sum up, it may be said that the defects in our
information as to the individual family, and the contradiction
and confusion surrounding it, do of themselves
justify an examination of this institution. These contradictions
are due probably not to any intrinsic reasons, but
to certain theoretical postulates and axioms adopted by
some of our informants. And as the exact description
of actual facts seems to suffer therefrom, a revision of the
theoretical side of the problem, as well as a collection
of evidence from a somewhat extensive number of sources
appears advisable.</p>

<p>But over and above clearing up some contradictions,
solving some difficulties, and filling up a gap in the information
concerning Australian kinship organization,
there is a much deeper justification for a detailed collection
and classification of facts referring to the individual
family in Australia. I mean, it is only such a proceeding
that can give us a scientific, correct and useful definition
of the Australian individual family (or any other social
unit in general). <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A priori</i> only a vague meaning can be
attached to the term "individual family," when it refers
to a society different from ours. For the essential features
of the individual family, as of all other social institutions,
depend upon the general structure of a given society and
upon the conditions of life therein. A careful and detailed
analysis of the family life and of the different aspects of the
family unit in connection with other social phenomena
is therefore necessary. Such an analysis enables us to
describe the said unit in a complete and exact way.</p>

<p>It is Dr. Rivers to whom we are indebted for
emphasizing the methodological standpoint in this connection.
In his article<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Anthrop. Essays, pp. 309 sqq.">[17]</a> he points out that we cannot
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> assert the existence of even such an apparently
unquestionable fact as individual motherhood in every
human society whether actual or hypothetical. To
affirm that in a given society motherhood is individual
and not communal (group motherhood), a strict analysis
<span class="pb" id="Pg7">[7]</span>
of a whole series of circumstances is necessary. Applying
Dr. Rivers' argument to the other family relationships,
we may say that all the circumstances referring to the
relation between man and wife, parents and children,
brothers and sisters, must be submitted to a careful and
detailed analysis; and that only such an examination can
give us the right idea of what may be called the individual
family in a given society&mdash;in this case the Australian
individual family.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor" title="Comp. below, p. 206, the second paragraph of footnote 1.">[18]</a></p>

<p>As mentioned above, many authors, who have contributed
so much in other respects to our knowledge of
Australian kinship organization, have not entered into
details as to the family life, or actual relationship. Even
Mr. Thomas, although he quite acknowledges the existence
of individual relationship, confines himself to the remark
that in Australia exists "the family in the European sense."
But this expression is not adequate. We cannot possibly
find in Australia any social unit that would exactly fit
the forms of our individual family; for this is intimately
connected with the structure of our society, and none of
the social conditions it requires are found in Australia.
We can only say a unit which is <em>analogous</em> to our individual
family, and even then we would be more metaphorical
than exact. Mr. Lang, on the other hand, is not exhaustive
enough for our purpose&mdash;which is a description of the
family unit that will define it fully for sociological use.
Nevertheless as he writes in reply to Dr. Rivers he has
accepted the latter's methodological standpoint, and he
gives a series of apposite remarks and examples. But he
concludes: "It is needless to give more examples; the
savage Australian does discriminate between his actual
and his tribal relations." This conclusion is quite correct,
but it is not sufficient. The mere affirmation that the
actual relationship exists and is recognized by the natives
is not enough. This has been obvious to every careful,
unprejudiced reader of the first-hand ethnographical
material.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg8">[8]</span>
The aim of the present study is to <em>define what</em> this
individual relationship is; to describe its different aspects
and features; how it manifests itself in its different social
functions and, as far as can be ascertained, how it must
impress itself upon the native mind. And here lies the
important methodological point on which some stress
must be laid. It is not <em>the</em> actual relationship, or <em>the</em> individual
family, or "family in the European sense" which
we have to look for in Australia. It is the aboriginal
Australian individual family, with all its peculiarities and
characteristic features, which must be reconstructed from
the evidence. It will be necessary to describe minutely
all the relationships generally embraced by the term
Family,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor" title="Defining that term only broadly at the outset.">[19]</a> and to describe them in terms taken from the
native social life. In other words we have to look for the
connection between the facts of family life and the general
structure of society and forms of native life; and to take
into account all psychological data available, such as
ideas on procreation and reincarnation.</p>

<p>Only by such a description can we reach a correct and
scientific definition of a given institution in a given society.
It is essential that the elements of this definition should be
taken from the conditions of social life in the given society.
As an example we may take the legal side of marriage.
Amongst us marriage is a legal act enforced on the one
hand by the authority of the law with all its complicated
social working and the power of the State at its back; on
the other hand by the authority of the Church, which
exercises a profound moral pressure in relation to this
institution. These or even analogous factors will be
sought in the Australian tribes in vain. And yet marriage
there is not deprived of its legal validity and of its social
sanction. It is not an act of mere fancy, brutal force or
accident, but the legal factors have there quite a specific
character, and can be found and understood only in connection
with the general tribal structure and government.</p>

<p>Besides all that has been said above against a general
<span class="pb" id="Pg9">[9]</span>
offhand affirmation, that the individual family exists in
Australia, it may be added here that such an assertion is
practically quite useless. No further conclusions or inferences
can be drawn from such a vague statement. Only
by knowing exactly and minutely all the features and characters
of the said unit can the different questions attached
to this problem be answered; only so can it be judged
whether the individual family or certain features of it
are survivals or innovations; or whether they are so
deeply rooted and connected with the social life and the
whole organization of the tribes, that neither of these
suppositions is justifiable. Such special and concrete
definitions of a given social phenomenon in a given ethnic
area, as the one which it is intended to give here for the
Australian individual family, can serve also as a basis to
form by induction a general conception of the individual
family; and only from a rich collection of such material
from different peoples can any sociological laws be constructed.
As said above, a general working definition of
the word individual family may be accepted at the outset
of our investigations. After a careful analysis of all
particular relationships concerned; and further, of the
economic unity of the family, division of labour within it,
legal sanction, etc., content can be given to the rough
definition laid down at the beginning, and scientific exactness
can be given to our conception of the individual
family in Australia.</p>

<p>It seems desirable in this place to make a digression in
order to consider the problem of law and the legal side of
social phenomena in the Australian aboriginal society, as
we shall often have to use these concepts. A more detailed
and exhaustive discussion of it would involve a treatise
on primitive law, but as I am unable to indicate any
place where the concepts in question are defined in a way
satisfactory for the present purpose, I define them here
briefly.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor" title="In the treatises on primitive law and on family law such general concepts as 'legal' or 'law' are never explicitly defined. Perhaps such a definition is superfluous for a specialist, but I think that especially in the ethnology of primitive peoples precise concepts and explicit definitions are necessary. I may, however, mention the following places where there are some attempts at definition&mdash; ...">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg10">[10]</span>
All social organization implies a series of norms, which
extend over the whole social life and regulate more or
less strictly all the social relations. We find such norms
and rules in the Australian aboriginal society, different
kinds being enforced by different forms of social sanction.
The validity of some is due to the evil results which are
intrinsically connected with their violation. So <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> we
know that the breaking of certain food taboos has as an
inevitable consequence premature grey hair, eruptions
on the skin, or some other mishap. There are other rules,
which are observed because any departure from them
would bring general contempt and ridicule upon the culprit;
a form of chastisement to which the natives are said
to be extremely sensitive. There are still other types of
social norms, sanctioned by a more direct collective action.
In some cases the magicians of the tribe will use the
dreaded method of "pointing the bone," thus bringing
about the illness and death of the culprit; or a regulated
fight ensues; or a man has to undergo a definite ordeal.
Occasionally a group of people organize an armed party
<span class="pb" id="Pg11">[11]</span>
on their own account, but with the consent of the community;
and so on.</p>

<p>Briefly it may be said that different types of social
norms have different kinds of collective sanction and that
we may suitably classify the norms and regulations according
to the kind of sanction they enjoy. Here seems the
proper place to introduce the concept of Law, Legal.
We can agree to call such norms Legal, which enjoy an
organized, more or less regulated and active social sanction.
To make this definition plausible, we may remark
that it makes the Australian legal institutions correspond
to what we call law and legal in higher societies. Further
it would be necessary, in order fully to justify our
definition, to show: (1) that among the Australian blacks
there exist such modes of regulated, organized and direct
social sanction; (2) that they differ from other modes of
sanction and that the collective mind is quite aware which
norms enjoy just this form of sanction.</p>

<p>In answer to the first problem we may generally point
to the existence of tribal government. That a kind of
centralized authority exists in Australia and that it has
well-determined functions has been shown at full length by
Howitt.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor" title="Trans. R.S.V., pp. 103 sqq.; J.A.I., xii, p. 35; J.A.I, xiii, p. 282. And especially Nat. Tr., chap. vi. pp. 295-354. The elucidation of the problem of authority and justice in Australia is one of Howitt's chief merits. In the passages quoted, there will be found ample material to exemplify all that is said in the text. I shall give, however, a few more detailed references on some special points. Howitt does not classify the facts according to the principle just enunciated. ...">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg12">[12]</span>
This government consists roughly speaking of headmen
and a tribal council, composed in the first place of old men
of the tribe, skilled magicians and experienced warriors.
This camp council seems as a rule the more influential
factor, and only in few cases are we informed of chiefs
with extensive powers.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor" title="Chiefs are reported by Taplin (Woods, p. 32); J. Dawson, pp. 5 sqq. But these statements, especially the latter, seem subject to doubt. Compare Curr, A.R., i. pp. 55 and 58. Howitt and his correspondents report chiefs among the Dieri, Tongaranka, Wiimbaio, Theddora, Yuin, Wiradjuri, Gurnditch Mara, Kulin, etc., Nat. Tr., pp. 297-320. Compare also Waitz Gerland, p. 790. ...">[22]</a> What is important for us is
that one of the main functions&mdash;if not the chief one&mdash;of
those central authorities is to decide in case of difficulties
<span class="pb" id="Pg13">[13]</span>
in tribal affairs and to give sentence, a function which is
that both of a legislator and of a judge.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor" title="See Wheeler, p. 122, where it is said that offences like murder by magic, breaches of the marriage regulations, and the revealing of ceremonial secrets are dealt with by the elders and headmen. The legislative powers of old and influential men is mentioned: Howitt, Nat. Tr., pp. 89 sqq. (new norms introduced by individuals under alleged supernatural command or vision). Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., pp. 12 sqq. (important changes in custom, law, organization by individual initiative), ...">[23]</a> The old men
are the only depositories of tribal lore; they also know
the rules and norms and how to apply them. We are
informed in many places that they discuss important
matters and decide vital questions; and especially in
cases where any law has been transgressed. They possess
also executive power; they can organize an armed party;
they arrange and control the regulated fights; and they
have also in their hands the personal power of punishment
by magic.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor" title="For the methods of carrying out justice, i. e. for the executive organs, see Wheeler, pp. 131-139, where the 'authorized agents' (avenging parties, etc.), regulated fights, expiatory ordeals and blood revenge, methods which, as different forms of carrying out justice, are more or less executions of a sentence and have the character of legal proceedings. ...">[24]</a> It may therefore be said in general that the
rudimentary form of central authority, as found in
Australia, possesses quite clearly traceable features of
juridical functions and executive power; it forms a kind
of tribunal, and it has its organs to carry out the sentence.
It is hardly necessary to add, that those institutions exist
only in a rudimentary form; but they appear to be quite
<span class="pb" id="Pg14">[14]</span>
unmistakable. Besides this central authority, which
sometimes takes the juridical functions upon itself, there
are other forms of organized action, carried out by groups
of individuals, personally interested in the case. Here
the legal character, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> the feature that distinguishes
such action and the underlying norm from mere violence,
fancy or custom&mdash;lies in the fact that such an action is
regulated by strict rules and prescriptions. And it is in
just such a mutual connection of a norm and social enforcement
that the fundamental feature of legality may be
seen. So <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> in the Central Tribes a man who has by
magic charmed away a woman can reckon upon the
actual support of a definite group of his kindred. The
legality of his act is based upon the existence of a certain
norm and the existence of a form of active and regulated
social support which enforces this norm. Without the
norm the social action would be mere violence. Without
the social enforcement the norm would be a moral or
customary rule; so enforced, it may properly be called a
law.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 554: '... a man's right to woman secured by means' of magic 'is supported by the men of his own local group.' Compare also the description of this method of charming away a woman in Proc. R. Geogr. Soc. S. Australia, vol. iv. p. 26, by F. Gillen.">[25]</a> It is impossible, for want of space, to deal here more
in detail with this question, which could correctly be
answered only by collecting all the evidence available, and
bringing the results into connection with the general
features of Australian society, such as age grades and
tribal secret societies. I only indicate here the point of
view, and I shall in what follows refer to it and exemplify
it by concrete instances.</p>

<p>The second problem, viz. whether the distinction
between the customary and religious rules and legal
norms may be considered as well defined in Australia, is
still more difficult to answer. The small differentiation
of that society hardly allows any very clear and definite
sociological distinctions. But, broadly speaking, it seems
that the distinction between (1) a trespass, whose
<span class="pb" id="Pg15">[15]</span>
punishment is supernaturally entailed by its very committal;
(2) a trespass, punished by ridicule and public
contempt; and (3) a crime, punished by the decision of
the community, acting as a whole, or by its central organs,
or certain groups of it&mdash;that this distinction between sin,
improper conduct and crime (as we can call those three
categories) is quite well marked in different features of
aboriginal social life. What might fully elucidate this
question, would be a collection of facts, classified
according to these categories.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor" title="So e. g. there could be placed in the first category different kinds of food taboos. In the Arunta, food procured or handled by certain relatives may not be eaten by a man; nor may be eaten any food in their immediate presence. Such food would disagree with the man. Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 469.&mdash;If certain food taboos were transgressed during initiation by the boys, their wounds would inflame. Ibid. p. 470.&mdash; ...">[26]</a></p>

<p>These few remarks are merely made to settle the
terminology. By definition a given norm or rule is Legal
if it is enforced by a direct, organized, and definite social
action. And by the word legal will be designated this
side or aspect of a given social relation which is regulated
by laws, as just defined.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg16">[16]</span>
Our considerations indicate also in what direction an
analysis of the social conditions in Australia would be
interesting from the point of view of primitive jurisprudence.
In the first place, there is a great variety of
modes in which the different legal norms are preserved,
impressed upon the social mind, and taught to different
members of the society. Here the connection of different
norms with religion, myth, totemic cultus, organization
of the secret society, etc., might be discussed. In the
second place a careful investigation of the different forms
of social sanction, based partly on belief, partly on collective
ideas and feelings, partly on actual institutions
and direct enforcement, might be carried out. In connection
with it there might be a classification of the
norms; and the domain of the purely legal norms, or
rather the properly legal aspect of norms and different
social phenomena could be exactly traced. In other
words each norm should be studied in connection with the
way in which it is "codified" (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> preserved for and
imparted to social knowledge); and in connection with its
sanction. In the case of a legal norm the tribunal and the
executive organs should be indicated as far as possible.
Undoubtedly we find in such a primitive society as the
Australian many institutions still in a state of confusion,
which on a higher level are quite well determined and
differentiated. But the more confused the phenomena,
the clearer our conceptions must be in order exactly to
follow the different ways in which the elements are interwoven
and combined. What is an isolated and defined
institution in a higher society, may be merely a side or
aspect of social phenomena in a lower one. But it is
highly important to use definite concepts to denote such
aspects or sides in undifferentiated societies, because it
often widens our horizon and puts our ideas to a crucial
test.</p>

<p>I wish to add that in the present case it is only the
necessity for clearness and convenience that makes a
definition necessary. The domain of primitive jurisprudence
<span class="pb" id="Pg17">[17]</span>
cannot be considered fully explored yet; the
chief aim of a good definition is to state the proper problems
and to show the groups of facts that must be inquired into
in order to give right answers to the problems proposed.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Having thus justified the scope of the present book
and indicated the general lines on which its task
should be carried out, a few words must be devoted to
the method of dealing with the evidence. We start our
investigations with (1) the Australian first-hand information,
and (2) a general idea of the object of our research,
that is a general idea of the individual family. This
implies that during the process of research these two sets
of data must be checked against each other. On the one
hand we must continually extract from the evidence all
that corresponds to our general idea of the individual
family; on the other hand this idea must be specialized
and determined according to the evidence.</p>

<p>It is clear enough what, broadly speaking, is meant by
the Individual Family. But what exactly will be the
features of this institution in Australia, that must be
extracted from the evidence. This evidence is, on the
other hand, given in the majority of cases in a very crude
state, without reference to any theoretical points of view.
The facts are often given in a purely casual and colloquial
way. It is part of the task to sift out each one of them,
and to ask if it can have any bearing on the present subject.
Many facts that seemed not to bear immediately
on it, yet furnished some very useful inferences. In
short, the first duty of such a work as the present is to
ask from the evidence right questions in the right way.</p>

<p>But even if a certain point has been settled upon as
essentially important to be inquired into, and information
referring to it has been gathered, the task is not yet
finished. The statements collected on this point will as
a rule present more or less radical discrepancies. After
<span class="pb" id="Pg18">[18]</span>
we have heard twenty opinions on the same subject
which by no means agree with each other, to which shall
we adhere? A method of dealing with evidence must
be fixed upon. In the first place the statements are of
the most heterogeneous character and value. They must
be submitted to some criticism before use can be made
of them.</p>

<p>After the degree of their reliability has been settled,
and after, by a criticism of each statement, some of the
contradictions have been removed, it must be considered
how far the differences between the statements may be
regarded as due to irreducible, local variations of the
given institution; in other words, the problem must be
discussed from the geographical standpoint.</p>

<p>Finally a certain system of weighing the evidence must
be chosen, so as to draw from it the most correct conclusions,
and never to prove too much or too little. So
there are three different processes: criticism, localization of
differences, and drawing of conclusions; all of which must
be done according to a careful and conscientious method.</p>

<p>A few remarks about the latter must be given here
without any attempt at completeness. That preliminary
criticism is necessary seems hardly to need justification;
to look at the irreducible inconsistencies and contradictions
of a series of statements concerning any given point is
enough. But such criticism must not be arbitrary; it
must conform to strict rules.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor" title="The ethnographic sources do not differ essentially from the historical ones. The purpose of a descriptive ethnography (such as is adopted in this monograph) is also nearly identical with the historian's task so far as positive statement of an actual state of things is the aim of both. The rules of criticism of sources apply therefore to our subject as well as to any other historic science. This will become obvious to every ethnographer who reads the excellent manual of MM. Langlois et Seignobos. ...">[27]</a></p>

<p>The first point to which attention must be paid, is to
ascertain the exact meaning of a given statement. As
many of our informants do not use exact terminology
<span class="pb" id="Pg19">[19]</span>
but write in a colloquial language, often spoilt by literary
pretensions, we occasionally run the risk of being misled
by a word or by a turn of expression.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor" title="We obviously do not speak here of such writers as Howitt, W. E. Roth, Spencer and Gillen, authors who had a theoretical training. But, as may be pointed out here, in the present work no writer is excluded, provided that he has had opportunities of first-hand observation, or opportunities of private information from first-hand observers.">[28]</a> In other words,
it never seems advisable to cling blindly to the verbal
meaning of a statement before having put it to the test.
So, for instance, in the problem whether the natives live
in families or tribes&mdash;the <em>family</em> and <em>tribe</em> having been
exactly defined, a phrase like "the aborigines live in
families" may not be accepted as argument, for by the
word "family" the author may possibly have understood
what we have designated by the word tribe.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor" title="See below the discussion of this topic, Chap. V., I.">[29]</a> I
shall, as a rule, quote each statement <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i>, and give,
if necessary, an interpretation or correction.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor" title="Much weight has been attached to a very extensive reproduction of the original text. More important statements are always adduced verbatim; less important, or too cumbersome ones, are abridged, but keeping as closely to the original words as possible.">[30]</a> The sense
in which a word is used may be, in the majority of cases,
easily settled from the context, examples given by the
author, and other instances where he uses the same
word. When a phrase is hopelessly ambiguous, it is
wrong to make any use of it.</p>

<p>After the sense of a statement has been settled more
or less reliably, two cases must be discriminated. If
the statement is purely a record of facts, and, still better,
if it is exemplified by concrete instances, there is generally
no reason to disbelieve it, especially if in the general
character of the author there is a guarantee of his trustworthiness;
and if he actually has had good opportunities
of observing the natives. But if the statement involves
a judgment, a generalization, or abstraction, we must
be much more careful. Broadly speaking, statements
of this latter kind are generally much more contradictory
than mere statements of fact. It will be seen that the
<span class="pb" id="Pg20">[20]</span>
information concerning the treatment of women by their
husbands, concerning sexual matters, and concerning the
authority of husbands, will present many more discrepancies
than the information concerning the modes
of obtaining wives, economics, and other concrete questions.
The first category implies much more abstraction
and qualifying judgment than the second. It must be
borne in mind that statements of the first category are
the result of a long and complicated series of mental
processes, and that their quality and value is dependent
upon many conditions. All these conditions must be
mentally analyzed and each of them must be taken into
account in order to ascertain its bearing upon the final
form in which we find the statement. The conditions
in question may be shortly set forth as follows: Did
the author possess all the qualities necessary for a good
ethnographer? Had he good opportunities to observe
the natives and a good method of doing so? Were the
latter still in a primitive condition, or in an advanced
state of decay? A few words may be said in the first
place about this last point.</p>

<p>Only in exceptional cases is it possible to say anything
definite on the state of the natives the author had under
observation.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor" title="For instance, we can judge this from Curr's Recollections; we know pretty well the state of the different tribes investigated by Howitt, Spencer and Gillen, and by Roth. In many other cases a general idea may be formed from different hints.">[31]</a> In general, it may be taken as a rule that
all writers who were in any close contact with aborigines,
had to do with fairly degenerated specimens. They
were usually squatters or missionaries, and had to do
with blacks hanging round farms or with remnants of
tribes gathered in missions.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor" title="The aborigines in their natural uncorrupted state appear to have been extremely shy, and great difficulties would undoubtedly have arisen had any one attempted to come into more intimate contact with them. But in the early days of the settlement of Australia there was nobody with such intentions. It is sufficient to read very early accounts, such as the voyages of Gov. Phillip, Barrington; as also accounts of explorers like Grey, Eyre, Leichardt, Mitchell, Sturt, etc., ...">[32]</a> Their immediate observations,
<span class="pb" id="Pg21">[21]</span>
especially in sociological matters, which are at
once affected, when conditions of life change, and when
blacks become degenerate, could be of little value. But
there was still the possibility of gathering information
from the natives themselves, who could, properly questioned,
give their recollections of the bygone times. This
was the way in which probably A. W. Howitt got so
much of the most valuable information on the Kurnai
tribe, which he never saw in its primitive state. But
only few writers had the mental training and the opportunities
of the writer just mentioned. And the majority
probably communicated to us simply what they saw&mdash;not
even considering the problem how far the conditions
then present tallied with the primitive normal state of
things in the aboriginal society. Allowance must therefore
be always made for the degeneration of the blacks
as a possible factor affecting ethnographical evidence.
In many cases there will be no room for doubt. For
instance, in sexual matters it is obvious that contact
with the white man invariably fosters a great deal of
depravity. An improvement in sexual morality may, on
the other hand, take place if the natives are gathered
in a mission station.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor" title="For examples how natives on mission stations may be forced into morality, legal and Christian marriages, etc., the reader may be referred to the personal diaries of missionaries. Compare e. g. the article by the missionary D. Mathews, l.c. pp. 48 sqq.">[33]</a> But this cannot have any connection
with aboriginal custom.</p>

<p>If, therefore, it is found, as is in fact the case, that all
writers, who either inquired into the matter with really
scientific precautions, or had to do with pure, primitive
material, inform us that, speaking broadly, the sexual
relations were strictly regulated; and on the other hand,
all settlers, casual observers, and people who obviously had
already corrupted blacks under observation, speak of unrestricted
immorality and even of incest,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor" title="See below, the statements, pp. 92 sqq.">[34]</a> it may be safely
said that the second type of statements refer to degenerate
blacks. Here the general <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> suppositions quite
<span class="pb" id="Pg22">[22]</span>
harmonize with what is to be found in the evidence; the
second type of statements may be therefore fittingly discarded.
In the same way it may be assumed that with
a general dissolution and corruption in the aboriginal
society, and with all kinds of vices engrafted upon it
the general level of conjugal affection and the standard
of treatment of the wife by her husband went down.
The contrary cannot possibly be assumed.</p>

<p>So it appears that, even from the quality of the
material the observer had at his disposal, some useful
hints may be obtained as to the direction in which our
statements need correction. Furthermore it was said
above that useful indications can be gathered from the
way in which the observer was in contact with the natives;
whether the observer was a long time in contact with the
natives or only a short time; whether he made his observations
with deliberate scientific aim, or whether
they were made casually and recollected afterwards;
whether he had good opportunities for observation, and
under what conditions this was carried on, and so forth.</p>

<p>All these questions may throw much light upon the
relation between the writer's statement in its final form
and the actual state of things to which it refers. These
questions are also in close connection with the point
mentioned below, touching the profession of an observer.
For it is usually the privilege of the missionaries to be in
a long and intimate contact with the natives, to have their
confidence, and sometimes to understand even their
language, while it is the ethnographer's privilege to
understand the aim of his inquiries. In some cases
there are fairly detailed data about these points, and
such information about the conditions and circumstances
under which the writer got his evidence greatly increases
its value. In all cases where the evidence is contained
in memoirs, diaries, descriptions of travels, expeditions,
etc., it is possible to form an idea as to what kind of relation
existed between the respective author and the material
of his observation. So it appears that Curr and Salvado
<span class="pb" id="Pg23">[23]</span>
had especially good opportunities; it is possible to picture
the way in which authors like Collins, Taplin, Grey, Eyre,
Lumholtz, Angas, Strehlow and others, came into contact
with the natives. This is much more difficult to say in
the case of writers who wrote only short articles (Oldfield,
Stanbridge, Bonney, Palmer, Cameron and others),
which merely give information without any details as to
how it was gathered. In the case of ethnographers,
observing themselves or collecting the observations of
others&mdash;like Howitt, Spencer and Gillen, Roth, and some
others&mdash;we might expect to be informed minutely about
the way in which they obtained their information.
Unfortunately this is only partly the case.</p>

<p>The questions how the condition of the natives, and
how the method of observation can affect the final statements
have been discussed at length. It was done in
order to exemplify how from such considerations may be
gathered useful hints, nay even positive indications, as
to the direction along which the given statement may be
corrected, if corrected at all. There are, besides these
points, several other important points referring to the
qualifications of the ethnographer that cannot be omitted
when any correction of statement is made. There is no
room to discuss them in detail; they would lead us too
far into the domains of methodology, of ethnographic
research. They must be enumerated briefly. So it is
quite clear, that not only the personal character but also
the profession or occupation of the writer influences very
considerably the value and trustworthiness and the
character of the information given. The personal character
of the ethnographer is a rather delicate matter,
but nobody could deny that some authors inspire us with
the belief that everything they say is their real conviction,
based on solid foundations of facts, while other authors
fail to produce the same impression on the reader. It
is also clear that a missionary, a police trooper, or an
ethnologist, will each look with different eyes upon the same
facts; each of them will group the essential features and
<span class="pb" id="Pg24">[24]</span>
generalize quite differently, and will express himself in
terms which are by no means of the same degree of exactness
and clearness. Ultimately each man will have his professional
bias: the missionary will be influenced by his
creeds and his moral ideas, the ethnologist by his theories,
and the squatter or police trooper will sometimes, where
there is room for it, allow play to his feelings, which usually
are not ones of pure sympathy for the natives. As a
matter of fact, it is allowable to speak without exaggeration
of professional types of information. That the
utmost caution is necessary, and that thus only are to be
found indications of the directions in which it is possible
to interpret some possible error, is an almost superfluous
statement. Of course a careful and complete study of
the whole work of an author enables one to judge much
better how far his profession or personality may have
affected his statements. And this is also the reason
why an ethnologist confining himself to a small ethnic
area is in a better position than the general one. For he
is able to know his sources better, having a much more
restricted number to deal with.</p>

<p>Not less important as regards our attitude towards a
given writer's statements is the purpose with which his
book is written. The greatest confidence of course is
inspired by books written with a purely scientific aim.
Even the articles of observers who are not men of science
are apparently much more carefully written if they are
intended for purely scientific use in serious scientific
journals (as some articles in the <cite>Journal of the Ethnological
Society</cite>, <cite>Jour. Anthrop. Inst.</cite>, etc.). Memoirs, descriptions
of travel, and so on, give&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ceteris paribus</i>&mdash;less
guarantee; often much more room is left to phantasy,
to a tendency to amuse, perhaps puzzle or interest.
Concrete instances of this could be easily adduced.</p>

<p>At the end of all his mental operations, each observer
had to generalize his observations, to express their common
features, and formulate these in abstract and exact
language. Here the most important points are personal
<span class="pb" id="Pg25">[25]</span>
intelligence and some mental training. The first is to
be found even among the casual writers; for only people
of a somewhat higher level of mentality would care to
observe and write down their observations. But mental
training in a scientific direction is exclusively to be found
among the ethnographers; some of them stand far above
all our other informants in matters of rather theoretical
aspect, especially if social phenomena are concerned.
And we may usually, in case of contradiction, take this
information as the firm basis from which to start the
operation of criticism. But on the other hand, there are
reasons to mistrust general opinions laid down by professional
ethnologists, for they are very often not simple
generalizations, but theoretical inferences. Cases will
be often met with where a general remark, which could be
taken as a statement of fact&mdash;and often is given in such
a form&mdash;appears after a more careful analysis to be quite a
conjectural deduction from purely hypothetical premisses,
or from incorrect definition. In all cases&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> where
actual existence of group marriage is alleged&mdash;it will appear
that this statement is a deduction from certain phenomena,
which allow of quite a different interpretation, and that
the term "marriage" is defined somewhat loosely.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor" title="Compare also above, pp. 2-5.">[35]</a></p>

<p>To sum up briefly: criticism of statements has in the
first place to ascertain the exact and correct verbal
meaning of each of them. In the second place many
general but sure hints are afforded by a detailed analysis
of the conditions under which the evidence was obtained
and set forth by the author. The important points
here are: quality of the material under observation;
modes in which evidence was obtained (by inquiries from
natives, by immediate observation, etc.); character, profession,
and training of the informant, including possible
bias, theoretical, moral, and personal. All these points
appear at first sight rather impalpable, but as shown
above they may afford good hints, especially if taken
into account simultaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg26">[26]</span>
Now we pass to the second point indicated above on
<a href="#Pg18">page 18</a>, namely, the discussion of the local differences
which may introduce some apparent contradictions into
the statements. Assuming the possession of a series of
statements, the correctness of which we accept within
certain limits, there may still be some contradictions
between them, due to the differences between the tribes,
to which these statements refer. The task will be consequently
to indicate these differences and to give certain
reasons why some of the contradictions may be dealt
with in this way and why others cannot be reduced to
local differences. In the first place, in order to facilitate
the application of the geographical point of view, the
survey of the statements will always be made in the same
geographical order. I begin with the south-east end of
the continent and proceed then westwards and northwards,
enumerating first the tribes of Victoria, then the
tribes of the South territory of South Australia. I proceed
over New South Wales to the Central and Northern
tribes; then to Queensland, ending with West Australia.
The order is kept only roughly without pedantic accuracy,
which cannot be achieved, as many writers do not
even trouble to localize their statements with anything
approaching exactitude.</p>

<p>It may now be laid down in which cases it is possible
to point with certainty to local differences between the
different tribes and reduce to these factors the contradictions
which are found. If the same author, who is known
to be well-informed concerning the whole area (either personally
or through reliable informants), points expressly
to such differences, there is no reason to disbelieve him.
Many such local differences are indicated in the extensive
works of Spencer and Gillen, and Howitt. As an example
may be quoted the differences in sexual matters, pointed
out by Howitt in <cite>Reports of the Smithsonian Institution</cite>
(compare below, <a href="#Pg100">pp. 100</a> and <a href="#Pg101">101</a>). But even in the case
of such reliable authors as the ones just mentioned it
should always be carefully considered whether they knew
<span class="pb" id="Pg27">[27]</span>
with the same degree of exactness all the tribes they
compare. Further, when there is independent information
about geographically-separated tribes from reliable
authors of the same degree of exactness, to whose information
we have reason to ascribe the same weight,
we may also safely point, if there are any contradictions,
to local differences. But if quite contradictory statements
about some tribe or tribes living in close neighbourhood
are given, we hardly feel inclined to attribute these
contradictions to local differences. A very important
indication of the advisability of introducing the element
of geographical differences is further the question whether
the tribes in question are in general different from each
other, and whether they belong to different types of
culture. Although very little can be said on that point,
still on quite broad lines we must, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> acknowledge that
the Kurnai were a tribe with many singularities, that the
Arunta and other Central tribes clearly differ from the
S.E. tribes, etc. As we shall make very little use of
the geographical factor, what is said above may be
considered sufficient on that point.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor" title="As far as I see, in the present state of our knowledge, it is only admissible to speak with greatest care and in very broad lines of the Australian types of culture. Interesting attempts have been made in this direction by Dr. Graebner, Mr. N. W. Thomas, and Father Schmidt. The two latter especially base their work on a profound and extensive knowledge, and formulate their results with the utmost reserve and carefulness. Fr. W. Schmidt has at his disposal the powerful instrument of linguistic knowledge. ...">[36]</a></p>

<p>Passing now to the third and perhaps most important
methodological point, we may say a few words as to what
method should be adopted for the drawing of conclusions
from evidence considered as reliable. This is neither a
logical proceeding, nor is it a kind of induction. Properly
speaking, a witness's statement may be either accepted
<span class="pb" id="Pg28">[28]</span>
or rejected. But in this book importance has been laid
on presenting the evidence in a quite definite way.
Evidence is not used in order to exemplify or to prove
a given assertion on a special point. Such a proceeding
appears to be rather dogmatic, for usually in such cases
the author gives preference to an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> opinion, and
looks afterwards for its confirmation in the ethnographic
first-hand literature. Owing to the contradictory character
of the latter, practically anything can be proved from it.
In the present book the author merely sets forth the
problem; for instance, such quite general questions are
asked, as: How are wives obtained in Australia? What is
the treatment of the wife by her husband? What are the
sexual relations in general? and so forth. On each of
those general topics evidence is afterwards collected,
without prejudice or preference given to any type of
opinion. There is, therefore, much less risk of bias or
one-sidedness; the whole care is to make the best of the
evidence thus collected; and a series of statements upon
a given subject is presented. Each of them gives information
on several points at once; at any rate each of
them may usually be analyzed into a series of simpler
statements. And this analytical operation will be our
first task. There is always one or more assertion sufficiently
general, or simple, which will be contained in all or
in the majority of our statements and will be contradicted
by none. These may be considered as established by our
evidence. On other points there will be contradictions.
Often these contradictions will be only apparent, due
to a confusion in terminology, or to the defective way in
which the writers have expressed themselves. Here
recourse must be had to our first form of criticism, to the
ascertainment of the exact meaning of each statement
(verbal criticism). If that fails, the contradictions must
be recognized as real ones. In case they cannot be attributed
to any local differences, we must try to eliminate
them. And on this point recourse must be had to the
criticism of the statements from the point of view laid
<span class="pb" id="Pg29">[29]</span>
down above (<a href="#Pg25">p. 25</a>). Some of the statements may be
discarded as untrustworthy; the correct interpretation
of others may be determined; and thus the contradictions
will vanish. Sometimes this is impossible; the contradictions
remain irreducible. Then they must be simply
pointed out, and there is nothing further to be done.
Undoubtedly much greater service is rendered to science
by pointing out really irresolvable contradictions and
obscurities than by establishing fallacious certitude.</p>

<p>Especially if on the part of the field ethnographers
there could be expected some interest in the results of
theoretical research, such indications of contradictions
on points, the theoretical importance of which should be
proved, would be of real value.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor" title="Mr. Thomas in his work on Australian kinship suggests at every step questions which apparently are quite within the scope of investigation, and upon which our present evidence gives no answer. But unhappily I have not been able to trace any influence of this important work in the recent ethnographic publications.">[37]</a> Only such a co-operation
between theoretical writers and observers can give us satisfactory
results. To make indifferent observation is easy.
To note essential things and give useful observations is
impossible without theoretical knowledge and an insight
into the laws of sociology. It would be better if field
ethnographers would consider the questions of theoretical
writers, and take into account in their scheme of investigations
the utilization subsequently to be made of their work.</p>

<p>Returning, after this digression, to our theme, it may
be observed that the method of dealing with evidence is
very simple: there is the analytical operation, of finding
the essential points contained in a series of statements;
in other words, the operation of analyzing these statements
into simple factors and stating which are common
to all the statements and may be accepted as well
established. A further task consists in pointing out the
irreducible contradictions. This operation obviously
contains all the others&mdash;criticism of the text and contents
of the statement, and reduction of contradictions
<span class="pb" id="Pg30">[30]</span>
to local differences. It is evident also that, although
theoretically the criticism of statements was dealt with
first, then the question of geographical differences, and
in the third place the problem of handling a series of
statements, as a matter of fact, the first step is to make
a survey of all our evidence, resolving it into a set of
problems, and then to take each problem separately; in
this way we shall find contradictions and endeavour to
eliminate them, and we shall be compelled to exercise
criticism on the statements.</p>

<p>I would like to add here that to help us in the decision
between several contradictory opinions, there is still
one criterion beside the hints enunciated above (which
refer to the character of each individual statement).
I mean the criterion whether the final opinion drawn
from the evidence is compatible or not with the other
well-established features of Australian sociology. When
deciding to adhere to some view, which is not established
by a unanimous and categoric opinion of all
our informers, it is always necessary to put this view
to the test of other well-established facts. There are
some views which are quite incompatible with the
general conditions of life in the Australian aboriginal
society and with the resulting mode of living. As a
good example of such deductive demonstrations we may
quote the passage in Curr, where he arithmetically proves
that the statement of Dawson about the Australian chiefs
and their court cannot be true.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, A.R., i. pp. 53 sqq.">[38]</a> Another example is
afforded by the interesting passage of Howitt quoted below
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i> (<a href="#Pg113">pp. 113</a> and
<a href="#Pg114">114</a>), which relates how the author
thinks that our ideas on group marriage should be modified
by what we know about the aboriginal mode of living
and about the natural character of men. As a rule it
is well always to try to ascertain whether our conclusion
does not stand in contradiction with some part of our
well-founded knowledge. Thus in practice it is always
necessary to start with a crude series of facts, and in any
<span class="pb" id="Pg31">[31]</span>
attempt at criticism to be guided by the contradictions
found in them. If then criticism and corrections, made
according to our rules, remove the contradictions, we have
another guarantee that our corrections were good. For
if a series of statements, which at first sight seemed to
present irreconcilable contradictions, do agree after we
have applied to such of them as were either in a minority
or appeared vague or came from uncertain sources, corrections
or interpretations (the latter based on principles
laid down quite independently), it may be concluded
that our reason for applying the correction and the way
in which we have done it, were sufficiently correct and
justified.</p>

<p>To use a series of statements as they are given would
be in the majority of cases quite impossible. All the
contradictions imaginable would be present, and we
should either helplessly drop any attempt at forming
an opinion, or we should get out of the difficulty by a
purely arbitrary act. We could by an act of faith
believe in some of our writers and accept only what
they say or what confirms their opinion, and completely
ignore any contradictory information. That would even
enable us to form a much more certain and detailed view
on many points. Our way of proceeding compels us
often to relinquish a very precise, definite opinion, which
we could hold if we accepted one statement to be ultimately
true, and neglected the others; but it gives us at
least the conviction that any more precise conclusion
would be unfounded. That all the corrections must be
carried out on grounds of ample justification and in the
most discreet way is quite clear. It will be seen that in
the subsequent pages only rarely have statements been
amended, and then the reasons are always given. But it
is important that even these few corrections should be
done systematically. The above indications will, I trust,
help to a certain degree to justify the method adopted
in dealing with evidence.</p>

<p>Our methodological considerations were necessarily
<span class="pb" id="Pg32">[32]</span>
taken on broad lines. To give a detailed and precise
description of the method of treating the Australian
material would require a whole volume, for there are in
all individual cases so many influences and possibilities
that may be considered as sources of error, and so many
elements to take into consideration, that it would be
nearly impossible to trace all the mental processes that
have to be followed here. I found it also impossible to
give explicitly all my reasons in each place where I
ventured to correct a statement. Nevertheless, I have
not thought it superfluous to give in outline the chief
points adopted in this criticism. In the first place
even these general hints will be quite sufficient to indicate
the writer's motives to every one who has had to deal in
an analogous way with ethnographical materials. And
then they will serve as a proof that these questions,
doubts, and precautions, were present to his mind
while weighing the evidence. In the last place, as
science is essentially based on mutual help and mutual
agreement, if we had a whole series of workers on a given
ethnographic material, a certain general assent, if such
could be obtained, would undoubtedly be the best criterion
of reliability of sources. But matters should be openly
and explicitly discussed.</p>

<p>To sum up, the chief methodological principle which we
have striven to keep always before us, is a thorough
clearness about every step of our reasoning. In the
first place, therefore, care has been taken to give an explicit
and a perfectly clear survey of the statements;
and to draw conclusions in such a way that all our reasons
for drawing them shall be as clear as possible to the
reader, so as to enable every one to apply his own criticism
as easily as possible at any stage of our reasoning.
Necessarily in a study such as the present one, some
allowance must be made for a subjective element in the
final judgments on the value of the evidence. But just
as the writer must ask for a certain amount of trust in
his scientific judgment, so he is bound to give every means
<span class="pb" id="Pg33">[33]</span>
to the reader to enable him always fully to judge and
exercise his criticism on the use the author is making
of this liberty.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this as far as in us lies, the methodological
principles set forth above have been adopted. They
are in short, as follows: We accept as facts those points
in which all statements agree. On controversial points
we try to eliminate the contradictions by applying textual
criticism to the statements, or by pointing out the possible
sources of error, or by showing that these contradictions
must be set down to local differences between the tribes.
In drawing conclusions, we shall point out those facts
which are well established, and also point out those
which are more or less uncertain or contradictory. The
sources used are not very numerous, but it is hoped
that they will be found sufficient. They have been
impartially chosen and include each of the various types
of Australian evidence.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II<br /><span class="pb" id="Pg34">[34]</span>
<small>MODES OF OBTAINING WIVES</small></h2>

<p>Keeping to these general methodological principles,
the aim of this study will be merely an objective, unprejudiced
description of the different forms of the Australian
family organization.</p>

<p>In accordance with what has been said above, let us
accept at the outset a general definition, along the lines of
which our investigations will be carried out. My choice
for this purpose is the well-known definition of Dr. Westermarck:
"Marriage is a more or less durable connection
between male and female, lasting beyond the mere act
of propagation till after the birth of the offspring." In
another place (<cite>Moral Ideas</cite>, ii. p. 364) Dr. Westermarck
completes this definition: "As a social institution, on the
other hand, it has a somewhat different meaning: it is a
union regulated by custom and law. Society lays down
the rules relating to the selection of partners, to the mode
of contracting marriage, to its form, and to its duration."
We may also remember that Dr. Westermarck first pointed
out that "marriage is rooted in family, rather than
family in marriage"<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor" title="(Hist. H. Marr., chap. iii.) Dr. Westermarck's work was written on much more general lines. He did not aim at a purely morphological reconstruction of family life in any ethnographical province. I did not, therefore, refer to his researches in the methodological sketch; here, however, they must serve as a starting point. It is the most exhaustive treatise on the individual family; ...">[39]</a>; and that he insists on the importance
of economic elements in family life, and especially
<span class="pb" id="Pg35">[35]</span>
on the facts of the rearing of children and the mode of
living.</p>

<p>These remarks of Dr. Westermarck, corroborating
what has been said in the introduction, direct our analysis
to the relationship between parents and children as well
as between the conjugal parties; resolving thus the
marriage problem into the more general family problem.
On the other hand, Dr. Westermarck, in these short
passages quoted, as well as throughout his work, insists
on the general and sociological aspect of family life.
We shall try to apply his points of view systematically
to our Australian material, keeping in mind the addition
of the legal side of the question.</p>

<p>As each relationship is intended to be separately
treated, let us begin with that of man and wife, and
especially with its "legal" aspect. The first point
for discussion will be the modes of obtaining wives.
In this the search will be for elements, that enforce <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso
facto</i> the validity of marriage; there will probably be
found in them the expression of some collective ideas,
referring to the validity, moral or customary sanction,
that marital union enjoys in the eyes of the native.
It is also highly important for the whole question of
marriage and family to ascertain whether the modes of
obtaining wives are subject to any norm, compliance
with which was enforced by an active intervention of
society in some form. Such norms, according to the
definition given above, would be legal ones, and they,
necessarily, involve and presuppose a series of collective
ideas, the knowledge of which would afford a deep insight
into the primitive social mechanism.</p>

<p>Betrothal or marriage ceremonies that would express
a sanction of purely social or even <em>mystic</em> or moral character
are few, although not quite absent. Nevertheless
the widespread practice of allotting young girls even in
infancy, or before birth sometimes, shows <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i>
how deeply rooted the idea of the individual right of a
man to a woman is in the native mind. Also in the case
<span class="pb" id="Pg36">[36]</span>
when wives are obtained by elopement or capture, there
are certain ordeals, formalities or duties, that give to
such a marriage its social sanction.</p>

<p>The following statements it will be seen present
but little field for correction. What we are asking for
in this place are merely facts which are evident and
palpable enough not to escape the attention of even
ordinary observers. Only the betrothal ceremonies and
acts seem to have been more esoteric, and therefore
they are reported in only a few cases, where the authors
were more intimately acquainted with native customs
and ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Statements.</i>&mdash;Amongst the Kurnai marriage was brought about
generally by elopement; sometimes by capture; and less frequently
by exchange or by gift.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Kamilaroi and Kurnai, p. 343. See also their modes of getting females by capture. Compare pp. 200 sq. and pp. 348 sq.">[40]</a> In cases of elopement "the male
relatives searched for her (the fugitive), sometimes with success,
sometimes without success. If the couple could remain away till
the girl was with child ... she would be forgiven."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor" title="p. 202.">[41]</a> Otherwise,
if found, she was badly chastised, and the man had to fight her
relatives. If they should persevere in their plans and elope two
or three times ... they would be forgiven.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[42]</a> The Kurnai are
the only people among whom elopement was the general rule.
The punishment was there accordingly not very severe, and the
marriage legalized in case of perseverance, or if the couple were
skilful enough not to allow themselves to be soon caught.</p>

<p>J. Bulmer, Lake Tyers, Gippsland, says that among the
Gournditch-Mara the majority of wives were obtained by exchanging
a sister or a near relative. Elopement was always
followed by bloodshed.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor" title="In Brough Smyth, i. p. 77. Compare also Howitt, Kamilaroi and Kurnai, p. 350.">[43]</a> "Marriage was by betrothal of children
by their respective parents, therefore by exchange of sisters,"
says Howitt<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 249.">[44]</a> of the same tribe.</p>

<p>Exchange of sisters (own or tribal) was practised by the Youin;
the marriage being arranged by the fathers; there was a mutual
public agreement between them. "The two being thus promised
to each other, the girl is looked upon as the future wife of the
boy." In cases of elopement, if there was a baby the marriage
was legalized, especially if a sister (tribal or own) could be given
in exchange.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 263 264. Compare also Trans. R.S.V., p. 117.">[45]</a> Here we may note that the arrangement was
made publicly, during one of the tribal gatherings. The future
brothers-in-law exchange gifts, and on the day of the arrangement
<span class="pb" id="Pg37">[37]</span>
keep ostentatiously the whole time together. Thus the whole
affair was known to everybody and had a sort of tribal approval.</p>

<p>Among the Woeworung girls were promised in infancy. The
arrangement was entered into by the respective fathers, then
made public. The old men of the tribe had to decide when the
girl was to be handed over to her husband. There was a kind of
betrothal ceremony consisting in a public giving up of the bride
to the bridegroom.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt in Trans. R.S.V., p. 116.">[46]</a></p>

<p>In the Bangerang tribe "wives were obtained by the exchange
of females with any other tribe; so that a man who had a daughter,
exchanged her for a wife, for himself or his son, as he thought
proper." The custom of exchange of females was a check on
abusive cruelty and ill-treatment by the husband. A Black said
once to Curr, "If he beats my sister, I'll beat my wife."<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, Recollections, p. 248.">[47]</a></p>

<p>In the Victorian tribes described by Beveridge, girls were
usually exchanged. It was the father who had to dispose of his
girl; there was no betrothal ceremony. Only the woman was
bound by the marriage; the man could always send her away.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor" title="Beveridge, p. 22.">[48]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the South-west Victorian tribes "parents betroth
their children when just able to walk."<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor" title="J. Dawson, p. 28.">[49]</a> The arrangement was
carried out by the respective fathers. As a sign the boy's father
gives the girl an opossum rug, shows her attention, and gives her
"nice things to eat." The girl's father visits sometimes her
intended husband. "No marriage or betrothal is permitted
without the approval of the chief of each party."<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 28.">[50]</a> The girl's
mother and aunts must not look at her intended husband from
the moment of betrothal.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 29.">[51]</a> In cases of elopement against the
wishes of parents fights take place. A second elopement makes
the marriage lawful.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 34.">[52]</a> Exchange of sisters exists also, with
consent of chiefs. The ceremony of betrothal is described at
length by the same author.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 31.">[53]</a> The bride and the bridegroom are
painted and specially dressed. Food is stored for the purpose,
as feasting and amusement accompany the ceremony. The chief
is present and gives his consent. Two months after the betrothal
the two do not sleep alone, but with the bridemaid and brideman.
The alleged approval of the chief in this statement would be
interesting, but here we may mistrust our author, for the general
information about the chiefs, their power, etc., seems to be not
quite correct (see Curr, <cite>A.R.</cite>, i. p. 53). Besides, the whole style
of the book is not strictly scientific, and shows signs of literary
embellishments. We must also attach some caution to the
detailed description of the betrothal ceremony. It is the only
account of a detailed and elaborate ceremony of this kind, with
feasting, chief, abstinency, etc. Interesting and important as it is,
we may attribute it to local exception, but we cannot consider it
as established beyond doubt.</p>

<p>Amongst the Wotjobaluk (S. Victoria) girls were exchanged in
infancy by the elder brother. The father's consent was essential:
<span class="pb" id="Pg38">[38]</span>
he could also dispose otherwise of his daughter. The marriage
arrangements and agreements were publicly made at large tribal
gatherings.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 241. Also Trans. R.S.V., p. 116.">[54]</a></p>

<p>Stanbridge says that "females are generally betrothed in early
infancy," either to friends, or to those whose friendship is solicited.
Although the father decides when she has to be given away,
"the bridegroom is sure of obtaining his bride, as the honour of
the family and of the tribe is considered to be involved in the
fulfilment of the betrothal." In case of subsequent elopement it
is the duty of the family to chastise the guilty pair.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 288. (Mount Gambier tribes.)">[55]</a> This statement
is not quite clear, inasmuch as we scarcely understand how
the mediæval idea of honour is to be applied to Australian Blacks.
Probably it means that the family and local group of the girl have
some reason to keep the promise; whether this reason be of
magical, legal, or customary character is an open question. But
inferring by analogy we may say that all these factors are coercive
here, as in the other tribes. The family must also support the
husband in case of elopement.</p>

<p>"Whenever a female child was promised in marriage to any
man, from that very hour neither he nor the child's mother were
permitted to look upon or hear each other speak, nor hear their
names mentioned by others; for, if they did, they would immediately
grow prematurely old and die." This statement refers to
the Jajaurung tribe of Victoria.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor" title="Brough Smyth, ii. p. 156, on the authority of some first-hand observer. Brough Smyth gives also (i. pp. 83, 84) a detailed account of courtship and betrothal. But according to our criterion we do not accept it as a first-hand evidence; nevertheless, it may be useful as illustration.">[56]</a></p>

<p>"Female children are betrothed usually from early infancy,
and such arrangements are usually adhered to," with rare exceptions.
Exchange of sisters is commonly practised, but the
parents' consent is essential. "If a wife be stolen, war is always
continued until she is given up, or another female exchanged."
These statements refer to the Lower Murray and Adelaide
tribes.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor" title="Eyre, ii. p. 319.">[57]</a></p>

<p>There is a very plain and primitive <ins id="C038" title="orm">form</ins> of betrothal, performed
by the "principal old man in the camp" amongst the Lower
Darling natives. They usually exchange sisters, and girls are
promised in infancy.<ins id="C038a" title="footnote marker missing in original"><a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor" title="F. Bonney, J.A.I., xiii. p. 129.">[58]</a></ins></p>

<p>Among the Parkengee tribe of the Darling River, "A brother
had the right of giving away his sister, which he usually did
with a view to his own matrimonial interests. They were in this
way promised when quite children, and in the event of the death
of the claimant, his nearest of kin became possessed of his rights."<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor" title="S. Newland, loc. cit., p. 21.">[59]</a>
This means that levirate was valid in case of betrothal.</p>

<p>Exchange was the chief feature of the Narrinyeri marriage.
Sometimes the father, usually the brother, disposed of the girl.
<span class="pb" id="Pg39">[39]</span>
There is a simple ceremony, consisting in a formal handing over
of the bride, who seems usually to be rather unwilling.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor" title="H. E. A. Meyer, quoted by Rev. Taplin, loc. cit., p. 10.">[60]</a> It is a

<p>Among the natives of Yorke's Peninsula, "Betrothal took
place in infancy, and the marriage ceremony after circumcision

<p>"In the Geawe Gal tribe marriage was ordinarily by the gift<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor" title="I think it means not by exchange.">[64]</a>
of the woman and by consent of both fathers ... and would be
arranged years before the time of marriage." In cases of elopement
the offender had to fight the female's relatives; he retained
her only if victor. In cases of capture, only a woman of the right
class could be retained.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, N.T.S.E.A., p. 216. Geawe Gal, Hunter River, New South Wales; possessing the Kamilaroi sub-class. See also Kam. and Kurn., p. 250.">[65]</a></p>

<p>In New South Wales marriage was arranged by the parents.
If two people fell in love, they eloped, but if the family applied
to the camp council, the latter would interfere and punish the
culprit.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor" title="G. S. Lang, p. 11.">[66]</a></p>

<p>Henderson says that among the Blacks of New South Wales
abduction always arouses fights.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 110.">[67]</a> Using legal terms, this means
that abduction of a woman, whether married or not, was considered
a crime.</p>

<p>Of the courtship in some of the New South Wales tribes we
have an account by J. Turnbull: "When a young man sees a
female to his fancy, he informs her she must accompany him home;
the lady refuses; he not only enforces compliance with threats,
but blows: thus the gallant, according to the custom, never fails
to gain the victory, and bears off the willing though struggling
pugilist."<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor" title="Turnbull, pp. 98, 99.">[68]</a> In the following context the author asserts that
violence is here a mere formality. It is difficult to say anything
definite about this statement. If it refers merely to the final
marriage "ceremony" it might be accepted. But if it is to be
accepted as describing all that refers to marriage, it is obviously
false. The author was a "circumnavigator," and in his voyage
round the world, about the year 1800, had probably little opportunities
for observing the Australian aborigines. Such statements
as this, uncritically accepted (as this is, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> in Waitz-Gerland),
are usual sources of error in ethnology and hence in
sociology.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg40">[40]</span>
In some other New South Wales tribes "the ceremony of
marriage is peculiar. In most cases the parties are betrothed at
an early age, and as soon as they arrive at the proper age, the
young man claims his 'gin' or wife."<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor" title="Wilkes (smaller edition), i. p. 225.">[69]</a> "The women are considered
as an article of property, and are sold or given away by
the parents or relatives without the least regard to their own
wishes."<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[70]</a> The well-known elements of infant betrothal, and a
kind of purchase of a female from her family, are contained in
this statement.</p>

<p>According to another author, who has written about the New
South Wales tribes, the girls are given away at a corroboree.
Sometimes they are "stolen," but then fights always ensue.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor" title="Hodgkinson, loc. cit., pp. 229, 230.">[71]</a>
This statement contains the feature of publicity of marriage.
It does not say anything about the conditions preceding such a
public allotment.</p>

<p>According to Tench, capture was the prevalent form in which
marriage was brought about in the Port Jackson tribes.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 199.">[72]</a> Tench
was in very early times at the settlement, but being a military
man and making only a short stay, he hardly had very good
opportunities of observing the natives. His statement cannot
outweigh all the contrary ones.</p>

<p>The statement of Barrington, who says that among the Port
Jackson natives blows are the usual mode of courtship and that
they are well accepted as a token of tenderness,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 168.">[73]</a> can only be
understood if we accept these facts as a kind of pretended marriage
by capture. But much importance cannot be attached to it.</p>

<p>Amongst some tribes in the neighbourhood of Sydney<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor" title="C. P. Hodgson, p. 220.">[74]</a> small
children are betrothed, and as a sign of that the girl wears a
necklace. In another place<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 243.">[75]</a> the same author says that marriage
by capture occurs.</p>

<p>Among the tribes of the South-east coast of New South Wales
(Hawkesbury River to Cape Howe) the "marriages are regulated
by a system of betrothal." "The old men assemble in council,"
and establish the relation of <i>Nanarree</i> between a boy and a girl or
woman. The boy then marries eventually the woman's daughter.
The <i>Nanarree</i> couple "theoretically occupy the position of son-in-law
and mother-in-law." They are tabooed to each other. A
man and woman may be <i>Nanarree</i> to several individuals.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor" title="R. H. Mathews in J.R.S.N.S.W., xxxiv. pp. 263, 264.">[76]</a></p>

<p>We read of an instance of a formal betrothal (called <i>Bahumul</i>),
although meagre in its ceremonial, among the Euahlayi tribe. A
baby girl is destined by her parents to be "given to a man."
She is brought to him, some feathers are taken off the baby's head
and put on the man's. Her grandmother says, "Look at him
and remember him, because you are promised to him." "That
makes it a formal betrothal, binding to both sides." "I have
heard great camp rows, because girls made a struggle for independence,
having found out they had only been promised, not
formally betrothed, to some old chap whom they did not wish to

<span class="pb" id="Pg41">[41]</span>
marry." Here we meet with an instance of a formality, which has
in itself much more than a simple promise, that is "binding for
both sides."<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor" title="Mrs. Parker, loc. cit., p. 55.">[77]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Dieri the individual or <i>Tippa Malku</i> marriage
was established when girls were quite young, and upon the basis
of exchange, the decision lying in the hands of the mother's

<p>The German missionary, L. Schultze, informs us about the
Central tribes that "the betrothal is solely and absolutely
arranged by the father of the girl. He promises and contracts
his daughter, within the limits of the class, to whomsoever he
pleases." "A youth cannot select a bride for himself, or a girl a
bridegroom." "The betrothal is often made by the father, soon
after the girl is born, from mercenary motives," for the future son-in-law
is obliged to hunt and provide his father-in-law with food.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 236.">[82]</a></p>

<p>By the detailed data given by Spencer and Gillen<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., chap. xvii, Methods of obtaining Wives, pp. 554 sqq. Compare also Nor. Tr., pp. 32 and 33.">[84]</a> we get a
good insight into the legal and customary side of the modes of
obtaining wives amongst the Central tribes of the Arunta nation.
Methods of securing a woman are (<i>a</i>) charming by means of magic,
(<i>b</i>) capture, (<i>c</i>) elopement, (<i>d</i>) the custom of <i>Tualcha-Mura</i>, by
means of which a man secures a wife for his son by making an
arrangement with some other man, with regard to the latter's
daughter. The legal side of the first method is shown by the
fact that a man's right to a woman, secured by means "of magic,
is supported by the men of his own local group."<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor" title="Compare also the detailed description of charming by magic (different methods) given by J. Gillen in Proc. R.G.S.S.A., iv. pp. 25 sqq.">[85]</a> Capture is
the "very rarest way in which a Central Australian secures a
wife." If captured by an avenging party, the woman must be
lawfully allotted to one of the men (who has exclusive right to her
afterwards).<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor" title="No other man of the party having any access to her. Nat. Tr., p. 556.">[86]</a> There is an accompanying ceremony, and the

In cases of elopement there was always a fight, sometimes between
the two parties only, sometimes their local groups taking part.
<span class="pb" id="Pg42">[42]</span>
There were some (tribal) relatives having a special duty of supporting
the eloper. Sometimes the aggrieved husband will consent
to hand over the wife; the offender has then an ordeal to undergo.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., pp. 556, 557. The story told, pp. 557, 558, where both the eloped woman and her actual husband have an ordeal to submit to from the former husband. After having renounced her in this way she became the property of the man with whom she had eloped.">[88]</a>
"The fourth and most usual method of obtaining a wife is that
which is connected with the well-established custom" of <i>Tualcha-Mura</i>.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 558.">[89]</a>
This is a relation between a man and his mother-in-law<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor" title="Who is often of the very same age as he, pp. 558, 559.">[90]</a>
established by a simple ceremony,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 559.">[91]</a> and it signifies that the
man has the right to take as wife the daughter of the woman. In
this way "practically every man in the tribe is provided with at
least one woman to whom he is lawfully entitled."<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., 554. As also Nor. Tr., p. 33.">[92]</a> He has a

for the obligations to be kept.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 555.">[95]</a> It is seldom that these obligations
are broken; and if the parents give the girl to someone else,

fiancé.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 560.">[96]</a> All this holds good also in respect to the Northern
Central tribes.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 77.">[97]</a> There, too, "as a general rule women are

<p>Among all the tribes, described by Spencer and Gillen, there
seem to be some marriage ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Nat. Tr., chap. iii., pp. 92 sqq., and Nor. Tr., chap, iv., pp. 133 sqq.">[99]</a> In their first work

tribes.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., pp. 92 sqq.">[100]</a> In the main these ceremonies consisted of a ritual
defloration of the girl by men standing to her in a definite relationship.
In each case the girl had to submit to sexual intercourse
with a series of men standing to her also in a definite relationship.
Men of forbidden degrees have on these occasions access to
women. The girl was afterwards painted and decorated and
handed over to her husband, to whom she was allotted.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor" title="For detailed description see Nat. Tr., pp. 92, 93 (Arunta and Ilpirra), p. 94 (S. Arunta), pp. 94, 95 (Kaitish), p. 95 (the remaining six tribes). These ceremonies differ only in details from each other in different tribes.">[101]</a> In
the <em>Northern Tribes</em> there is also a detailed description of
this ceremony among the Warramunga,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 135.">[102]</a> where the husband
keeps abstinence for three days after marriage. Among the
Binbinga, Anula and Mara tribes the ritual defloration seems not
to be a marriage ceremony, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> seems not to be connected with
the handing over of the girl to her allotted husband.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 135.">[103]</a> Messrs.
<span class="pb" id="Pg43">[43]</span>
Spencer and Gillen state the existence of this ceremony among
sixteen tribes. It is to be noted that these ceremonies do not
seem to express any special sanction of the marriage to which
they lead, unless they are viewed as "expiation for marriage."<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor" title="According to Lord Avebury; see Nat. Tr., p. 96.">[104]</a>
Then they might be interpreted as the renouncement of all
men's rights and claims to a woman for the benefit of her
future owner. The ceremonial handing over of a woman may
be also regarded as expressing the public sanction of marriage.
We must still notice an interesting ceremony amongst the
Warramunga, Tjinjilli, Gnanji, Binbinga, Mara, which consists
of some hair being given by the maternal uncle of the girl to her

<p>Among some tribes of South Queensland (Bunya-Bunya
country) marriage was arranged without any consent of the
contracting parties. Sometimes it was arranged when the girl
was an infant, and she was then promised to some man of importance
or influence. Sometimes exchange of females took place
at large tribal gatherings. Elopement was known in these tribes,
and a fight decided whether it was legalized or not.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor" title="Tom Petrie, loc. cit., pp. 59, 60.">[107]</a></p>

<p>We find a ceremony of betrothal among the Kuinmurbura.
"The parents having painted the girl and dressed her hair with
feathers, her male cousin takes her to where her future husband
is sitting cross-legged in silence, and seats her at his back and
close to him. He who has brought the girl after a time removes
the feathers from her hair and places them in the hair of her
future husband, and then leads the girl back to her parents."
The future son-in-law must give presents of game to the father of
his promised wife.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Trans. R.S.V., p. 118.">[108]</a></p>

<p>We read about the natives of Moreton Bay, that marriage is
generally contracted with the consent of the relatives of both

<p>We find in Brough Smyth an account of a betrothal ceremony, as
practised by the natives on Fraser Island (Queensland). This description
is given by a correspondent of the Rev. L. Fison: "The

feathers on her head; then the bride places feathers on the head
of the bridegroom; the bridegroom makes a fire, and every one

between them the intended bride (whilst in the other they each
carry a piece of burning wood) towards the intended husband,
he standing with his back towards them. When they arrive at
the appointed place, the parents lay down the burning pieces of
wood, beside which the child sits down, and the parents retire, on
which the husband turns round to his wife and takes her home."<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor" title="Wilson, p. 144.">[122]</a></p>

<p>We are informed about the natives of the Cape of York Peninsula

may be, and often is, an old man with several wives."<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor" title="Macgillivray, loc. cit., ii. p. 8.">[123]</a></p>

<p>J. Forrest, speaking of the natives of Central and Western
Australia, says: "Betrothal is very general. A child a year old
will sometimes be betrothed to an old man, and it will be his duty

when she is old enough she becomes his wife."<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 317.">[124]</a></p>

<p>"The girls are not the exclusive property of the father until he

appropriated to certain males of the tribe, and not even the
parents have the right to set aside these obligations." If
this man dies, the mother may dispose of her daughter.&mdash;This
refers to the Watchandee tribe of West Australia.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor" title="Oldfield, p. 249.">[125]</a> The same
author writes that elopement is punished in these tribes

statement is quite unique in this, that it asserts no right of the
family to betroth their daughter. On the other hand, we are by
no other author informed of such a thing as a man having an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> right to a girl. We are led to the supposition that these
male individuals are simply men belonging to the right marriage
class. For undoubtedly in an exogamous tribe, having four or
eight classes and being not too numerous, the number of marriageable
individuals must have been very limited, and one of them
might have had some special prerogatives. This supposition
would also account for the severe punishment inflicted in case of
elopement with a man to whom "she did not lawfully belong,"
viz. with an individual of the improper class. Otherwise this
statement would be contradictory with all the others, and we
could hardly harmonize it with the general view we form of the
aboriginal marriage rules.</p>

<p>In West Australia "female children are always betrothed
within a few days after their birth; and from the moment they
are betrothed the parents cease to have any control over the
future settlement of their child." The woman is kept by her
husband as his exclusive property. "Stealing a wife is generally
punished with death." It means that elopement was punished
by death, but we are not told if of both parties or only one, and
which one. This statement agrees with our last one. It might
be, therefore, that in West Australia the rules were in this regard
more stringent. But it seems more probable that death was
<span class="pb" id="Pg46">[46]</span>
the extreme punishment only, and that usually an ordeal was
sufficient.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor" title="Geo. Grey, ii. pp. 229, 230.">[129]</a></p>

<p>We are informed in G. F. Moore's vocabulary of West Australian
languages that the word meaning "firm," "fixed" is "applied
to a man and wife as firmly united together."<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 5.">[130]</a> It shows that
this idea must have been strongly inculcated in the aboriginal
society, if the expression for firmness and marriage were associated
in their language. By itself, such a linguistic argument might
be justly designated as futile; but it is a valuable addition to the
other evidence in our possession. The same author mentions
three modes of obtaining wives: infant betrothal, inheritance
from a brother or relative (levirate), and elopement.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 41.">[131]</a></p>

<p>We read in Scott Nind's description of the aborigines of King
George's Sound: "The girls appear to be at the disposal of their
father and are generally bespoke in their infancy; even before
they are born we have been told to whom they were betrothed,
if they prove to be females." Sometimes exchange of relatives
is practised. In some cases boys are adopted as sons-in-law&mdash;a
custom called <i>cotertie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 38.">[132]</a> This seems to be analogous to the
customs reported from Central Australia and New South Wales.
"Attentions and presents are paid more to her (the bride's) father
than to herself, and indeed the trifles she receives are generally
transferred to him. These chiefly consist of game or other
articles of food; the father, perhaps, receives a cloak, spears or
other implements."<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[133]</a> The author says: "I do not think they
have any nuptial ceremony."<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor" title="p. 38.">[134]</a> Another mode of procuring a
wife is to carry her off; sometimes against her will, generally by
mutual agreement. In both cases the couple must beware of the
husband's revenge. If the female become pregnant and presents
are given to the husband, she is released from her first engagement.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[135]</a>

lifetime to a man, to whom she passes when widowed.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor" title="p. 39.">[136]</a></p>

<p>Browne relates that girls were often promised in infancy;
elopement also often took place.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 450.">[137]</a></p>

<p>We have also six statements in the answers given to Professor
Frazer's <cite>Questions</cite> (<cite>J.A.I.</cite>, xxiv., pp. 157 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sq.</i>). I have not
ranged them with the foregoing, for they seem not to be of equal
accuracy<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor" title="They are given by police troopers, stationmasters, etc. One of them is Sam Gason, whose information about the Dieri we know from another place. It is crude, but not quite useless; here he does not teach us anything new.">[138]</a> except perhaps that of Police Inspector Foelsche, Port
Darwin, North Territory, South Australia. And this agrees with
the majority of our data: girls are promised in infancy to men of
different ages, and go to live with them when arrived at puberty.
It is noteworthy that all these six statements deny the existence
of any betrothal ceremony. Five of them inform us that wives
were obtained by "purchase" from their parents. The word
purchase covers, probably, the fact that the girl's parents obtained,
<span class="pb" id="Pg47">[47]</span>
at the marriage contract, and probably ever after, gifts from their
future son-in-law. We have such statements already in our
collection, and it seems that wherever there was no exchange of
females the girl's family received some compensation for her in
another form.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to our already described methodological
plan, the area or range of the facts covered by all this
evidence must be divided into smaller fields. Or, in other
words, it is needful to bring our information under several
headings, show the points upon which there is complete
agreement, and discuss the other points in greater detail.</p>

<p>There are forty-nine statements (including one of the
six just summarily mentioned). Not all of them give us
full information concerning the whole of our subject; some
mention only one or other of the methods of obtaining
wives, without asserting or denying the existence of the
other forms. But roughly speaking, we may say that in
all tribes there are on the one hand some normal, pacific
modes of obtaining wives (exchange of relatives, promise
in infancy, betrothal), and on the other hand some more
or less violent forms (elopement, capture). About
twenty-three of the forty-nine statements, all which
are explicit and reliable, assert the existence of both
these forms amongst the tribes they deal with. The
violent forms, elopement and capture, seem to have
been rather the exception than the rule, but there seems
to have been not a single tribe in which elopement was
completely absent.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Trans. R.S.V., p. 118. Howitt says that in all South-Eastern tribes elopement was in use; especially if there was any difficulty in finding a relative for exchange, or if two people fell in love with each other. It was considered a breach of custom and law, but it was a valid, recognized form of marriage if legalized subsequently. Practically the same may be said of all tribes of the continent.">[139]</a> Among the Kurnai elopement was
a prevalent form of marriage. In all other tribes the
methods, called here normal or pacific, were prevalent.
The main features of these forms are: betrothal in infancy,
exchange of sisters or relatives, and a series of
obligations and mutual duties which both contracting
<span class="pb" id="Pg48">[48]</span>
parties undertake. All these features may be briefly
discussed.</p>

<p>The custom of <em>betrothing</em> females <em>in infancy</em> seems to
be very widespread. That this custom was known in all
tribes appears in all the statements explicitly or implicitly
(with the exception of those statements only which were
discarded as unreliable, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> those which assert marriage
by capture as the most usual form). So in the tribes
described by Howitt and his correspondents (chiefly
referring to Victoria, New South Wales, and South
territory of South Australia) girls were as a rule promised
in infancy, and these engagements were kept. This
appears the most usual way of obtaining wives amongst
the Central tribes, in Queensland, and in West Australia
(J. Dawson, Curr, Stanbridge, Howitt, Eyre, F. Bonney,
R. H. Mathews, Spencer and Gillen, T. Petrie, Grey,
Browne); whereas according to Oldfield, girls belonged
by birth to a certain man. In Roth's statement we
are not informed whether women were allotted by camp
council in infancy or when grown up.</p>

<p>This widespread custom of infant betrothal had its
important consequences, some apparent at first sight.
So it is evident, that not only had the woman no voice
as to her husband, but even the latter had scarcely a
choice in the proper sense of the word. For when he
entered into the engagement, although he was often of a
mature age, he could not have any idea how his bride
would look when grown up. The legal importance of
this form of marriage and all the mutual obligations
connected therewith will be discussed below.</p>

<p>Another point of importance is that this form of marriage
contract was in many tribes combined with the
<em>exchange</em> of sisters or relatives. Fifteen statements
mention this explicitly as the most usual condition under
which a female could be obtained. It must have been
prevalent in the South-Eastern tribes.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor" title="Speaking of the South-Eastern tribes in general, Howitt says: 'It may be safely laid down as a broad and general proposition that among these savages a wife was obtained by the exchange of a female relative, with the alternative possibility of obtaining one by inheritance (Levirate), by elopement, or by capture.'&mdash;Trans. R.S.V., p. 115.">[140]</a> In the case of
<span class="pb" id="Pg49">[49]</span>
exchange it was usually the sister who was given in exchange
for a wife,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor" title="'It seems to me that the most common practice is the exchange of girls by their respective parents, as wives for each other's sons, or in some tribes the exchange of sisters, or of some female relatives by the young men themselves.'&mdash;Trans. R.S.V., p. 116.">[141]</a> but sometimes also a father secured
a wife in exchange for his daughter (Curr, Taplin, Beveridge),
which is in perfect accord with the fact that disparity
of age was very frequent in Australian marriages.
At any rate the father's consent was always essential
(Stanbridge, Beveridge, Schultze, Taplin on the Narrinyeri,
Rusden on the Geawe Gal, Howitt on the Wotjobaluk).
In general when a girl was promised in infancy
it was always done by her family; or at least with the
consent of her family. As, for instance, in N. Central
Queensland, where, according to Roth, girls were disposed
of sometimes by the camp council, but by agreement
with the family. By the word family must be here
understood in the first place the girl's father, whose
consent, as just said, was essential, then her brothers
and nearest relatives, who would eventually have profit
from exchanging her. But also other members of the
female's family are interested in the transaction and
possibly benefit by it.</p>

<p>The important <em>part</em> played by the <em>family</em> appears in
all our statements; the only contradictory one is that of
Oldfield, who says that the parents had no right over
their daughter from her birth (but see above our critical
remark). From the moment of the "betrothal" the
man or boy enters into a certain relation to his future
wife's nearest relatives; he has certain duties to perform,
certain obligations to fulfil, and certain restrictions to
observe. In the case where it is the male's family which
makes the contract for him, the two families have certain
duties towards each other and stand in a certain mutual
<span class="pb" id="Pg50">[50]</span>
relationship. They exchange gifts (Yuin, Woljabaluk,
S.W. Victoria and others); the boy's father has to
give presents to the girl, and the boy is visited from time
to time by his future father-in-law (W. Victoria); the
future mother-in-law is tabooed (Jajaurung, New South
Wales, according to R. H. Mathews; Central tribes);
in the Central tribes there is the relation of Tualcha
Mara and the duty of hunting for the future father-in-law.
In the Binbinga there is a present at the betrothal and
sometimes duties afterwards.</p>

<p>It seems that in all cases, even when exchange does not
take place, it is the father who disposes of his daughter
(compare just above). This privilege is important:
in this way, as we saw above, an old man may procure
a young wife for himself. In other cases by these means
the friendship of an influential man may be gained. It
is therefore probable that the father, who wields all the
authority in the family, enjoys this privilege of disposing
of his daughter.</p>

<p>We may view the facts of exchange of females on the
one hand, and the various duties of the husband towards
his (future or actual) wife's family on the other, also in
another light; they show distinctly the features of
<em>marriage by purchase</em>. In the first place let us remark
that the two forms&mdash;exchange of females and exchange
of gifts or duties for a female&mdash;seem to be localized in
different areas. We saw that Howitt affirms that exchange
is the prominent feature in the South-eastern
tribes with the exception of the Kurnai. In those of our
statements which refer to this area we found with very
few exceptions (J. Dawson, Stanbridge, G. S. Lang,
Mrs. Parker) confirmation of his views. The above
exceptions do not deny this fact. They are not very
explicit, so that we can hardly insist on them as negative
evidence. On the other hand, in the Central and Northern
area, exchange of females seems not to take place. Here
we have some detailed statements, such as those about
the Dieri by Gason and Howitt, about the Arunta by
<span class="pb" id="Pg51">[51]</span>
Spencer and Gillen, about the other Northern tribes by
the same authors, about the N.W. Queensland tribes by
W. E. Roth. In all these explicit statements there is
not a single remark about exchange. Nor is the latter
mentioned in any statement referring to the Central
and Northern area, nor in the four statements which refer
to West Australia. We may therefore conclude with
a high degree of probability that we have here to do
with a real geographical difference between the tribes
indicated. As to Queensland, exchange was probably
known in the Central and Southern tribes (Tom Petrie
and Lumholtz mention it), whereas, as we saw, it was
absent in the Western part of that colony. But in nearly
all these tribes, where exchange of females is apparently
not in use, there is evidence of the existence of duties
and obligations on the part of the future husband towards
his parents-in-law. We may remember the five statements
in which the word purchase was used, and the statement
of Wilkes. Schultze says explicitly that the father
often gave his daughter away from mercenary motives.
The same is confirmed by the more exact and detailed
statement of Spencer and Gillen, where the duties of providing
the father-in-law with game are reported to be
a necessary condition for the obligations to be kept. Among
some of the Northern tribes (Binbinga, Anula, Mara) the
man has to present his father-in-law with boomerangs and
weapons at the contract, and then to supply him with
game. There is no information about purchase-marriage
either from Queensland or from West Australia. But
such a negative evidence is not convincing. Again
among the Kurnai, where exchange of females happened
very seldom, there were duties of supplying the parents-in-law
with game (compare below, <a href="#Pg283">pp. 283</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>). So that if
we leave on one side the Western part of Australia and
Queensland, and take into consideration only the Northern,
Central and South-Eastern tribes, we may say that exchange
of females and obligations, of gifts and hunting
duties were geographically exclusive. Now it appears to
<span class="pb" id="Pg52">[52]</span>
me that exchange of females was a kind of marriage by
purchase. If we regard as the chief feature of the latter
the fact that the bridegroom has to contribute for his wife
something of more or less equal value, we must agree
that exchange of females was such a kind of contribution,
and even a very fair one.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor" title="With reference to the Australian facts Dr. Westermarck makes the same remark. 'The simplest way of purchasing a wife is no doubt to give a kinswoman in exchange for her.'&mdash;H.H.M., p. 390.">[142]</a> Besides, it appears that
the exchange of females was often accompanied by exchange
of gifts (compare <a href="#Pg50">p. 50</a>, Yuin, Wotjobaluk). That
the facts reported from the Central and Northern area
show a form of marriage by purchase appears quite clear.</p>

<p>As a further characteristic feature we are told in several
instances that such mutual agreements are made <em>publicly</em>,
during great tribal gatherings, so that all the tribe knows
about it (Yuin, Woeworung, New South Wales according
to Mathews, New South Wales according to Hodgkinson).
Or else the bride is publicly handed to the
bridegroom (Narrinyeri, Lower Darling, Kuinmurbura,
Fraser Island). In the Central and North Central tribes
there are outward signs: the maternal uncle's hair worn
under the arm-band; or hair is procured from the future
mother-in-law. In some New South Wales tribes a
necklace is worn as a sign of engagement (Hodgson).</p>

<p>In some statements we are directly told that there
is no <em>betrothal or marriage ceremony</em> (in the six notes
in <cite>J.A.I.</cite>, xxiv.). But this negative evidence seems
on one side to result from the slight and superficial
acquaintance these observers had with the aborigines;
on the other side from the fact that even in cases
where we have such ceremonies described by very reliable
informants and their binding power asserted, they are
described as being so simple and insignificant, that it
is easy to conceive they might readily escape the notice
of even a good observer, or at least their nature and
importance might be misunderstood. We possess nine
statements about betrothal or marriage ceremonies. We
<span class="pb" id="Pg53">[53]</span>
have Dawson's detailed statement, which seems, nevertheless,
not to be absolutely trustworthy. But we are
also informed of the existence of some simple and apparently
insignificant ceremonies by J. Bonney, Taplin, R. H.
Mathew, Mrs. Langloh Parker, Spencer and Gillen, Roth,
Fison's anonymous correspondent, Howitt on the Kuinmurburu,
Wilson.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, A.R., i. p. 107, says also that in some tribes there are some insignificant marriage ceremonies.">[143]</a> Some of these are our best sources.</p>

<p>Turning now to the other, the <em>violent form</em> of obtaining
wives, we may distinguish the <em>elopement</em>, when both
sides are consenting, and <em>capture</em> where the woman is
secured by a mere act of brutal force. These latter
forms occur, but they are by no means frequent. They
are mentioned by several writers (Hodgson, Rusden,
Turnbull, Tench, Barrington and Collins); and by the
two latter as the only form of marriage. That this is
obviously incorrect was mentioned above in connection
with their statements. It is characteristic that all
statements reporting the prevalence of marriage by capture
refer to New South Wales, and more especially to the
neighbourhood of Sydney. But I think that it would
be inadvisable to attribute this to a local peculiarity
of those tribes. It appears more probable that as all
those reports date from the early days of the settlement,
and were written nearly at the same time, their opinions
cannot be considered as independent, and they are probably
repetitions of the same erroneous view which may
be assumed to have been held by the general public in
the settlement.</p>

<p>This is confirmed by the following comparison of two
statements. The first, that of Collins, stating the existence
of a crude form of marriage by capture runs thus:
"These unfortunate victims [the wives] of lust and
cruelty ... are, it is believed, always selected from
the women of a different tribe from that of the males
(for they ought not to be dignified with the title of men),
and with whom they are at enmity.... The poor wretch
<span class="pb" id="Pg54">[54]</span>
is stolen upon in the absence of her protectors. Being
first stupefied with blows, inflicted with clubs or wooden
swords, on the head, back and shoulders, every one of
which is followed by a stream of blood, she is then dragged
away through the woods by one arm, with a perseverance
and violence that it might be supposed would displace
it from its sockets." In this manner the woman is said
to be dragged to the man's camp, where "a scene ensues
too shocking to relate."<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt in Smiths. Rep., p. 798.">[144]</a> The second statement made
by one of Howitt's reliable correspondents, depicts the
state of things with quite different colours: "When a
young man has passed a certain number of Boras (initiations)
he has a right to choose a wife from among the
unmarried and otherwise unappropriated women of the
tribe who are of the class permitted to him by the native
laws. He claims the girl in the presence of her parents
by saying 'I will come and take you by and by,' and
they cannot refuse her to him unless he be specially
disqualified&mdash;as, for instance, if his 'hands are stained
with the blood of any of her kin.' And even in that
case he may carry her off by force if he can in spite of
their refusal. For this purpose he generally comes by
stealth and alone. But if he be a very bold warrior,
he sometimes goes openly to the girl's camp and carries
her off, defying the bravest of her friends to meet him
in single combat if they dare to stay him."<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[145]</a> In this
second statement it may be noted that only the unappropriated
girls of the tribe and those who are lawfully
marriageable may be obtained in this way. Besides,
this proceeding appears much more in the light of elopement
than capture.</p>

<p>Important it is to note that in utter contradiction with
those few statements, made by some early observers in
New South Wales, <em>capture</em> is usually reported to be merely
an exceptional form of contracting marriage. That it
was in existence in nearly all tribes seems beyond doubt.
<span class="pb" id="Pg55">[55]</span>
Spencer and Gillen, Howitt,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., p. 343.">[146]</a> Curr<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor" title="A.R., i. p. 108.">[147]</a> mention that marriage
by capture occurred. But all these authors add emphatically
that this was the most exceptional mode of acquiring
a wife.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor" title="That capture of females occurs only very seldom is affirmed by Palmer, loc. cit., p. 301, and by Taplin, p. 10. J. Mathew, J.R.S.N.S.W., xxiii. p. 407, states that marriage by capture takes place between members of hostile communities. Quoted from Dr. Westermarck, H.H.M., p. 389.">[148]</a> And it appears from Spencer and Gillen's
account that capture is effected rather by an avenging
party than by an individual enterprise. And even in
the case of capture, possession does not mean right.
The woman must belong in the first place to the right
class (Rusden, Spencer and Gillen), and in the case related
by Spencer and Gillen she had to be especially allotted
to one of the men by the leader of the party.</p>

<p><em>Elopement</em> on the other hand is, as we mentioned above,
to be found in nearly all tribes. In all cases it is considered
as an encroachment on the rights of the family or of
the husband over the girl, and it is punished. But the
severity of punishment seems to vary according to
the tribe; in the Kurnai elopement was probably the
most usual way of getting married; it was therefore not
so severely punished. The latter seems to apply to all
Victorian and New South Wales tribes. In the Central
tribes charming by magic and subsequent elopement
led to a fight or ordeal, but the matter was apparently
not very serious. Whereas, we read in Roth, Grey,
Salvado and Oldfield that the punishment was death.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor" title="Also Curr, A.R., i. p. 108, affirms that elopement was usually severely punished and only very seldom legalized. He knew only three cases where eloped couples were allowed to live together permanently.">[149]</a>
Nevertheless, as we have come to the conclusion that
these three statements are not quite clear on this point,
we may not take this for granted as a geographical distinction
between the South-Eastern and North-Western
(including W. Queensland) regions. It may be also
that abduction of a woman was punished by death or
<span class="pb" id="Pg56">[56]</span>
at any rate more severely in case she belonged to a forbidden
class.</p>

<p>In general it may be said that elopement was always
punished, and in the majority of cases afterwards, under
certain conditions, legalized and acknowledged. These
conditions are: in the first place that bride and bridegroom
belong to the right class; and then, pregnancy of
the woman or the birth of a child (Kurnai, Yuin); or a
victory in the fight which ensues after the offender has
been caught (Kurnai, Yuin, Davis, Central tribes); or
subsequent exchange of a relative (Yuin, L. Murray,
Wakelbura); or a second or third elopement (Kurnai,
W. Victoria). Victory in a combat did not mean that it
was by pure force that the offender kept the woman.
For these combats were regulated and often assumed the
form of an ordeal to be undergone (Central and Northern
tribes). It is well to notice that the majority of our
informants when speaking of elopements never observe
the point whether the woman was already married or not.</p>

<p>A few theoretical conclusions from all the facts just
enumerated may now be drawn. We have asked at the
outset for all the actual circumstances, as well as legal
factors connected with the modes of obtaining wives,
which express and enforce the validity of marriage.
We asked also how does the mental attitude of the native
express itself in these facts, as far as individual marriage
is concerned. Must we admit that the aborigines have
an idea of individual conjugal rights?</p>

<p>In the first place it is quite obvious that according to
our definitions of the word <em>legal</em>, the ideas of legal and
illegal may be applied quite legitimately to the Australian
marriage. For there exist different norms, the compliance
with which assures to a match its recognition by
society, and actual protection at its hands. Whereas,
if a marriage was brought about outside these legal
norms it had either to be legalized afterwards, whereupon
it enjoyed the same privileges, or it was considered
illegal and was interfered with. It appears, moreover,
<span class="pb" id="Pg57">[57]</span>
from all the facts reviewed that it was always a difficult
matter to secure a wife outside the usual forms. The
legal norms for marriage consisted in the bringing about
the marriage in one of the forms discussed above, and
consequently in the fulfilment of the series of conditions,
obligations and duties connected therewith. In all these
forms there is involved some kind of control of the social
group concerned, which enforces the mutual obligations,
and which in case of breach of contract had the privilege
or the duty of amending the wrong. In the most frequent
form, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> when a female child is promised in infancy,
her family is under an obligation to keep the arrangement.
Her relatives have not the right to dispose of
her otherwise after they have once promised her (Curr,
i. 107), and they must also watch over her and prevent
any attempt at capture or elopement, as they would
have the duty of rescuing her (Curr, Stanbridge). In
this case we are also told that the respective local group
would interfere. The fact that the engagement was
made publicly, and so was known and acknowledged by
all the members of the local group and perhaps even
of the whole tribe, emphasized its legal aspect. The cases
where the tribal authority disposed of the girls or had to
give consent itself shows this in a still stronger degree.
We see therefore that two social factors were involved
in the legal side of the marriage: the family, which was
responsible for the carrying out of marriage and often
for its maintenance,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor" title="Family means here in the first place the father, who disposed of his daughter; or in some cases the brother or near relative, who got or will get a wife in exchange for her.">[150]</a> and the community,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor" title="Or better, what was called above the tribal government.">[151]</a> which gives
its consent and often controls the right performance of
expiatory ordeals. It may also be remarked that the
mere moral sanction, which stamps one act as right and
another as wrong, gives a strong support to the offended
party and paralysed the help that the friends would
perhaps like to give to the offender. Although it is
difficult to adduce sufficient evidence in order to show
<span class="pb" id="Pg58">[58]</span>
in detail what were the obligations of the family and where
the tribal supervision began&mdash;and it seems that these
matters were possibly settled only roughly and on broad
lines in the Australian society&mdash;one thing appears quite
clearly from the whole evidence, viz. that in all tribes
only those couples were secure from any interference
who had married according to the legal form or whose
marriage was subsequently legalized. We are informed
by Spencer and Gillen that in some cases (when elopement
was brought about by magic) there were some
relatives who were lawfully entitled to help the eloper.
This shows also clearly how little the settlement of these
affairs was arbitrary. Elopement was in this case, and
in all others, considered as a trespass; when it was a girl
it was an encroachment on the rights of the family;
when it was a married woman it was an offence against
her husband and also perhaps against her family. According
to circumstances and varying with the tribe, it was
considered as a more or less serious trespass and punished
accordingly. In order that an elopement might result
in an acknowledged union, it had to be followed always
and invariably by certain expiatory acts. Even in the
case of capture, we saw in the example given by Spencer
and Gillen that the woman was lawfully allotted to one
of the party. Individual capture seems to occur very
seldom; in its legal aspect it would not differ essentially
from the elopement, but it would have had probably
less chances of being made valid.</p>

<p>After the legal aspect of marriage has thus been
established, it may be pointed out that several of the
features of Australian marriage and betrothal set up,
besides these legal bonds, other ties which in themselves
lead to the carrying out of marriage, and afterwards keep
husband and wife together.</p>

<p>In the first place, exchange of women. When a man
was to receive a wife in exchange for his relative, it is
clear that he felt himself strongly bound to keep his
promise; for he lost as much as his partner in case he
<span class="pb" id="Pg59">[59]</span>
broke the agreement. We saw also that betrothal
established a certain status between the families of the
male and the female respectively. This status, the main
feature of which was exchange of gifts, with a preponderance
of the male's gifts and duties, such as providing
food, created certain obligations which further
enforced the validity of the contract.</p>

<p>As pointed out above, we can even find, at least in the
Central and Northern tribes, clear features of marriage
by purchase. Equally important in this light is the fact
of exchange of females. This has its theoretical consequences.
The two main facts of collective psychology,
expressed by marriage by purchase, are (1) that there
is a certain value attached to the woman and expressed
by the conventional price; (2) that there is the idea of
right of property or at least of the individual personal
right of the husband over his wife, acquired by him
through the fact of purchase. These two facts are very
important. For both these sets of ideas can only have
been evolved in a society where individual marriage was
a well-known, well-recognized and fundamental institution.
There would have been no reason to pay for a
wife if the possession of her would confer no positive
rights on the owner.</p>

<p>The following point may also be adduced here, viz.
that generally the old men and other men of influence
and power secured the young females of the tribes. It
was easier for influential and important men to maintain
their right over their wives before as well as after actual
possession. Besides, we are informed by all (with the
exception of R. H. Mathews) that the rules of exogamy
were very strong, excluding in the majority of tribes a
good number of females from all attempts by the males
of forbidden classes. This undoubtedly contributed also
to increase the security and validity of the marital union,
by reducing to very few the number of the men who
were in a position to interfere with the rights of the
husband.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg60">[60]</span>
If we now look behind the facts of all these customs,
rules and practices to the underlying social psychology,
we see that the idea of the individual rights of a man to
a woman must have been deeply impressed upon the
aboriginal mind. The female, when promised in infancy,
belonged to a certain man, who afterwards took possession
of her. Neither he nor she had a choice; she belonged
to him by the title of obligation; he had no choice, for
all the other females were already distributed. Thus,
as infant betrothal was prevalent in the majority of the
tribes, there was a status in which everybody belonged
to somebody or other. At least there were no free females.
That such a state of things is indicative of a deeply-rooted
idea of personal, individual rights over a woman seems
clear. If the value of such rights were not known,
nobody would care to secure them so eagerly and so
early, especially as the acquirement of these rights
was apparently never gratuitous. On the other hand,
this complete allotment of all the females of the tribe
must have in turn impressed upon the native mind the
idea that marriage is a question of regulated rule, of a
well-established order, and not a question of private
initiation and enterprise. If a man chooses the other
way, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> tries to conquer a wife, he must be prepared
to undergo the consequences of it and thus expiate for
having broken the custom and rule. It must also be
borne in mind that legal norms presuppose the existence,
in the society in which they are in force, of quite clear
and definite ideas of the rights which they involve. It
is impossible that in a given society there would be norms
concerning the legality of individual marital rights
without the idea of such individual right being known
to the social mind. In Australia there are such legal
norms, as has been shown above. And <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i> there
must be not only a clear idea of the individual rights
of a man to his wife, but these rights must be highly
valued.</p>

<p>Marriage contract in nearly all societies is accompanied
<span class="pb" id="Pg61">[61]</span>
by some ceremonies, which possess in themselves some
binding force, generally of a magical and religious character.
This seems to be the case in Australia too. We
are in no place told what in a given ceremony would have
magical power, and how the natives imagine the working
of this power. Nevertheless, we read that in North
Central West Queensland the exchange of fire-sticks is
binding, and that among the Euahlayi the simple promise
of a girl does not create any obligation unless it is strengthened
by the act of formal betrothal. It can mean only
that to such acts was attributed some magical power,
and that this was coercive.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor" title="Reasons have been already advanced to support our belief that such betrothal ceremonies were in fact more frequent than our informants report. Considering now the force attached by the natives to what is called infant betrothal, we perhaps have another reason to justify this supposition.">[152]</a> From whatever form of
superstition it may be derived, it seems beyond doubt
that the rudimentary ceremonies described above, such
as exchange of fire-sticks, placing of feathers, joining of
hands publicly, etc., had some inherent force and an
importance as sanctions. They were a form of sacrament.
Now I would like to point out that whenever
it happens that a certain legal or social fact is transformed
into a sacrament, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> is supposed to be accomplished
by the performance of some formality endowed with a
supernatural sanction, we have every reason to suppose
that this legal or social fact is very deeply rooted in the
collective mind, that it corresponds to very inveterate
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor" title="There is no room here to discuss this general assertion at length. But it may be made plausible by pointing out that a certain status must be quite fundamental in a society to get the religious sanction (for instance monogamy in our country), and that it requires undoubtedly a long process in order to transform this sanction into a formal act and put into a material form the accumulated action of many social forces.">[153]</a> This seems to be, therefore, also the case in
Australia, where individual marriage has also its kind of
sacrament. This is another fact, another social institution,
in which the collective ideas of the community find their
expression. And everywhere we find not only that the
<span class="pb" id="Pg62">[62]</span>
idea of individual marriage exists, but that it by
no means bears the features of anything like recent
innovation, or a subordinate form subservient to the idea
of group marriage. As well in the betrothal ceremonies
as in infant engagements, in the ideas of legality of marriage,
exchange of females and purchase of the wife&mdash;in
all these facts we find that the aborigines have a deeply-rooted
idea and high appreciation of the individual
rights of the husband to his wife.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor" title="In what these individual rights consist will be discussed in detail below. Evidently it is erroneous, though a frequent error, to understand here exclusively the sexual rights.">[154]</a> It is also to be noted
that, as Spencer and Gillen inform us, when a man wished
to persuade a woman to elope with him, he resorted to
magic; in this presence of a magical element lay a certain
degree of justification that ensured him the help of some
of his relatives.</p>

<p>In short the modes of obtaining wives enforced and
expressed of themselves a good deal of the validity of
marriage. We have still to ask if the marriage was
binding for both sides or only for the female. This is
an important question and closely connected with the
legal aspect of marriage. For marriage being a kind of
obligation, the question presents itself, whether only
one party was bound by it or both. There is but little
direct evidence upon this point in the statements.
Beveridge asserts stoutly the latter; from Dawson's
statement we conclude that the former was the case,
as he says that a man could only under certain conditions
repudiate his wife and had to ask the permission of the
Chief. But it must be borne in mind that marriage
had by no means the features of a contract into which
both consorts would enter with mutual agreement.
Marriage in Australia must be much more viewed in the
light of a privilege acquired by the man, and for which,
as we saw, he usually has to pay in one way or the other.
It was always a great advantage to a man, both for
sexual and economic reasons, as will be clearly evident
in the respective chapters. The economic advantages
<span class="pb" id="Pg63">[63]</span>
persisted even when she grew old (compare Lumholtz,
p. 207). It was therefore scarcely necessary to compel
an individual to fulfil an obligation that was advantageous
to him. It may be therefore said that marriage, being
an advantage for a man&mdash;usually acquired by exchange,
gifts, or an act of bravery, sometimes inherited (Levirate)&mdash;was
an obligation binding on the woman in the first
place. There are practically no reasons to suppose that
a man would ever repudiate a wife. As long as the
woman was young, her husband tried obviously by all
means to keep her, and would display all his personal
force and social influence to frustrate any attempt at
abduction. When his wife grew old he would, perhaps,
secure a new one if possible; in two of the few authentic
anecdotes told of the natives a man is represented as possessing
one old wife and another quite young (see Grey,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, ii. pp. 350-361, and Curr, <cite>Recollections</cite>, pp. 141-145);
there was no reason to repudiate the old one, as she
would go on working and providing food for her husband.</p>

<p>In the statements referring to treatment of women,
there will be some which show that husbands sometimes
displayed a great affection towards their old wives. Moreover,
Mr. Mathew's statement (on p. 73) mentions explicitly
that marriage bonds lasted usually for life; Roth
and Lumholtz inform us that great respect was often paid
to old women, consequently it can hardly be supposed
that they were cast off by their husbands as useless. We
must also remember that usually there was a great disparity
of age between the husband and wife. As infant
children were often betrothed to mature men, when they
reached puberty their husbands were quite old already.
Such a woman was kept until the death of her husband,
when she fell to the lot of his younger brother or the
nearest relative (tribal brother) who wished to keep her.</p>

<p>The practice of the Levirate seems to be very widespread.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, S.E. Tr., pp. 193, 224, 227, 236, 248, Kulin tribe, p. 255; Yuin tribe, p. 266; Kurnai tribe, Kam. and Kurn., p. 204; Trans. R.S.V., p. 118; Wotjobaluk, Wakelbura, Turribul, Trans. R.S.V., p. 118; J. Dawson, p. 27; J.A.I., xxiv. p. 170 (Gason on the Dieri); Ibid., p. 194 (Inspector Foelsche on the Pt. Darwin tribes); Lumholtz, pp. 160, 161; Salvado, p. 278.">[155]</a>
To us it seems to be in the first place the
<span class="pb" id="Pg64">[64]</span>
expression of the idea of complete right of a man over
his wife. With his death this right was not extinguished,
but only passed to his nearest relative. If she were
elderly she would probably become the property of a
young boy, as these were usually deprived of wives.
Such couples&mdash;of which one was quite young and the
other more than mature&mdash;seem to be very frequent.
In these cases marriage lasted till the death of the older
party. From this it may be concluded that it was the
husband's interest to keep his wife. As to the latter,
the only way in which she could have dissolved the
marriage bonds appears to be by finding a protector with
whom to elope. This undoubtedly occurred from time
to time. But then it was not a simple pacific dissolution
of marriage, only an act of violence, always pursued
with varying vehemence, as shown above.</p>

<p>From all this we may conclude that marriage was not
as a rule an ephemeric occurrence among the Australian
natives. In the majority of cases it lasted for life;
anyhow, for a long period. To supply here the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum
crucis</i>, let us quote some contradictory instances.
Lumholtz says that the women usually change their
husbands so often that the children do not generally
know their fathers and never grow very attached to them
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 193; comp. below, <a href="#Pg245">p. 245</a>). Salvado, speaking
of the unhappy lot of an aboriginal beauty, mentions
that she has very often to pass from hand to hand, being
continually coveted and captured by some new lover
who is stronger than her actual possessor. The same
is related by Grey. Lumholtz's cursory statement is
not explicit enough to enable us to judge whether it
were not formed from observations of "civilized blacks."
He was only a short time in personal contact with the
natives, and what he gathered from the settlers applied
<span class="pb" id="Pg65">[65]</span>
probably in the main to blacks corrupted by contact
with civilization. Salvado's and Grey's information
applies only to exceptional cases when the belle excited
special passions by her personal charms. Besides, from
all we know, elopement, and still more capture, were
not every-day occurrences which would follow each other
in the case of the same woman. On the contrary, if an
exceptionally desirable woman were taken away by some
strong and influential aggressor from her lawful husband,
the former would have power enough, personal and social,
to retain her, if he had enough to secure her. That elopements
occurred and that they were more frequent in the
case of a beautiful and useful woman is beyond doubt.
Still the picture that we would form from these three
statements does not seem to fit the framework of the
other facts.</p>

<p>The question as to the length of the normal duration
of the Australian marriage is a very important one.
And, unhappily, the scanty evidence does not allow of a
sufficiently clear and detailed answer. Nevertheless, the
few statements that say anything about this matter
point to a lifelong duration, or at least to a long period
of marriage. At any rate the view often expressed that
the primitive pairing family is a highly unstable unit,
formed and dissolved very frequently, according to the
whim of the moment, without any serious obligation for
a longer duration of the common life&mdash;this view appears
absolutely denied by the Australian evidences. It is
impossible to find a direct answer in the evidence to
the question whether the general rule was duration for
life, or whether, after the wife became useless both
sexually and economically, she was repudiated. But
our short discussion pointed rather to the first view.
Moreover, if marriage were not a serious matter and if
it were possible to form and dissolve it without further
ado, all its features set forth in this chapter (legality,
actual obligations, purchase, etc.) would be absolutely
unnecessary; in fact they would be quite unintelligible.
<span class="pb" id="Pg66">[66]</span>
In such a low society as the Australian especially, when
an institution (here individual marriage) shows so many
aspects, even in a rudimentary state, it proves that this
institution has a very firm basis. As the act that brought
about marriage was usually one of importance and subject
to many conditions, so also an attempt to dissolve
it was grave in itself and in its consequences.</p>

<p>Now let us summarize our results in a few words.
Marriage was brought about as a rule in the form of
infant betrothal, which was binding on both parties;
it was accompanied by the exchange of relatives; always
there were certain mutual obligations. In cases when
a man secured a wife without her family's approval (but
usually with her own consent), this act was considered
a trespass, both in the cases of a girl and of a married
woman. The couple was pursued, and unless the elopement
was in some way expiated and legalized, both were
punished. The idea of legality may be safely applied
to Australian marriage in all its forms. For in all there
was the necessity of a previous or subsequent sanction
of society, and if this were absent society used actually
to interfere with the union. The idea of the individuality
of marriage was also quite clear to the aboriginal mind
and expressed itself in many of the facts connected
with the marriage contract. It may be added that it
was only in marriage by elopement that the man and
woman had a free choice. In all the normal cases neither
of them had any voice in the matter at the time of actual
marriage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><span class="pb" id="Pg67">[67]</span>
<small>HUSBAND AND WIFE</small></h2>

<p>It may be said that marriage in either of its forms
makes the woman the property of her husband. We must,
of course, carefully define the word "property." This we
shall do by analyzing the economic duties of the woman,
the sexual rights of the husband, and in general, the
limits of marital authority, and the features of the
treatment applied by a native to his wife. As the
economic aspect will be better described below, in connection
with the family life in general (including relations
of parents to children), I shall here pass briefly over this
point, remarking that the economic function of a wife is
most important in the aboriginal life. She has to provide
the regular food supply, to undertake the drudgery
of camp life, the care of the children and all household
implements, especially on marches. There remains the
sexual aspect of marital life and the authority of the
husband, including the treatment of the wife.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the latter question and pass in review
some statements illustrating the general character of the
marital relations; the limits of the husband's authority
and power; the actual use he makes of his authority,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> the treatment of the family; and last, but not least,
what idea may be deduced from our evidence as to the
feelings of the two consorts towards each other. On
this subject few reliable statements will be found, and
even these will be rather contradictory. And it would be
unreasonable to expect anything else. We are asking
here not for a report of plain facts, but for a judgment
<span class="pb" id="Pg68">[68]</span>
on more or less complicated and hidden phenomena; this
refers especially to the psychical side of the question,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> to the problem of conjugal affection. But even the
other aspects of the problem&mdash;authority and treatment&mdash;although
they are but a sum of facts, are always given
in the form of vague general assertions and in that of
qualified judgments.</p>

<p>Very few writers trouble at all about the deeper,
underlying phenomena. What they see is the way in
which a woman is treated by her husband; they often
judge this way according to their own moral principles
and sensitiveness. They forget that, using the words of
Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, "what would cause very
serious pain to a civilized woman only results in trifling
discomfort to a savage." For all these reasons there
will be more scope for corrections in these statements
than in the series given above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Statements.</i>&mdash;Amongst the Kurnai there were certain limits
to the husband's authority: "Although a man might kill his
wife under certain circumstances, and his act would be then
approved by custom and by public opinion, yet, under other
circumstances, he might not do so without incurring blood
feud."<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Kam. and Kurn., p. 206.">[156]</a> All the duties of the family were "shared equally"
by man and woman.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor" title="See below on economic side of family life.">[157]</a> This statement, as to the limits of
authority, is in agreement with all we shall find afterwards:
nobody and nothing could interfere with the husband if he
ill-treated his wife, unless her life was threatened. Then her
relatives intervened. What the expression of "sharing the
duties" means, is not quite clear. If it refers to economic
functions, we shall have a better picture later; but it stands
as a contrast to such expressions as "slave" or "drudge,"
used in connection with the wife's rôle by so many writers. In
another place Howitt says: "I have known many instances ...
including several cases among the Kurnai, of men carrying their
wives about the country when too old or too sick to walk."<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 766.">[158]</a>
This would point to a great affection, not only resulting from
erotic motives, but from real attachment, such as unites human
beings who have lived and suffered much together.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg69">[69]</span>
Among the Bangerang "community of interests between
man and wife is much less than amongst civilized people.
The husband gorges himself before he gives the rest of his
food to his wife. He is a constant check on her free will and
inclinations. She regards him more as her master and enemy
than as her mate. But as she is not very sensitive, and
educated to her lot, she bears it patiently, and after a year
or two she is happy on the whole."<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, Recollections, p. 259.">[159]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the Australian aborigines in general, Curr
says:<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor" title="A.R., i. pp. 60, 110. Curr knew personally only the Bangerang tribe, and some others in North Victoria (Glenbourn and Murray tribes), and his general observations must be taken as framed on this material, as he does not seem to be sufficiently aware of how many and deep differences there might be between different tribes.">[160]</a> "The husband is almost an autocrat. His wife he
may ill-treat as he chooses. In rare instances he will exchange
her for another, repudiate, or give her away." He may
not kill her; her relatives would kill the first of his blood.
"Otherwise the husband may treat his wife as he likes."
"The husband is the absolute owner of his wife. He may
do as he pleases with her, treat her well or brutally, ill-use
her at his pleasure; keep her to himself, prostitute her,
exchange her for another, or give her away." But he adds,
"Yet ... they are, on the whole, fairly happy, merry and
contented."</p>

<p>Amongst some West Victorian tribes, "notwithstanding this
drudgery and the apparent hard usage to which the women
are subjected, there is no want of affection amongst the
members of a family."<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor" title="Dawson, p. 37.">[161]</a> The author speaks even of "persistent
disrespect and unkindness" of a wife towards her
husband;<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 36.">[162]</a> he speaks also of women being "legally separated"<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 35, 36.">[163]</a>
from their husbands; and of magic charms worked by husbands
for punishment of their wives;<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 36.">[164]</a> all this would point
rather to a regulated and less brutal treatment. Here we
have the usual concurrence of "hard usage" and affection.
Characteristic is the addition of "apparent" to "hard usage."
It is, perhaps, the whole style of treatment which appears
to be hard to a European observer: the scale is shifted, but
undoubtedly the nervous system of the natives is less responsive,
too. What Dawson says about separation and
husbands recurring to magic to influence their wives, seems
to speak still more in favour of the good position of women.
But we must remember, that in his whole book, Dawson
<span class="pb" id="Pg70">[70]</span>
uses rather bright colours to picture the native character,
and tries never to say anything that could shock a European
reader.</p>

<p>Bonney asserts that "quarrels between husband and wife
are rare, and they show much affection for each other in their
own way." Apparent coolness in their relations is required
by custom. He gives an example of a couple who "loved
each other," and did not even greet after a long absence.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 130.">[165]</a>
According to the statement the treatment of women was
fairly good, and there was also no want of mutual affection.</p>

<p>Angas writes that among the aborigines, whom he had
under observation (Lower Murray tribes), the man walks
proudly in front, the woman following him; she is treated
like a slave, and during meals receives bones and fragments
like a dog.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. pp. 82, 83.">[166]</a></p>

<p>About some of the Lower Murray natives we are told by
Eyre, "But little real affection exists between husbands and
wives." "Women are often sadly ill-treated by their husbands,"
"beaten about the head with waddies," "speared
in the limbs," etc. Here we have bad treatment based on
absolute authority and complete want of affection. Besides,
we are told, "each father of a family rules absolutely over his
own circle."<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., ii. pp. 321, 322.">[167]</a></p>

<p>A statement of Mitchell (quoted by B. Smyth, i. p. 85),
suggests that there could not be much affection between
husband and wife. "... After a battle they (the women)
do not always follow the fugitives from the field, but not
infrequently go over, as a matter of course, to the victors,
even with young children on their backs."<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor" title="This statement refers, probably, to the Murray and Darling River tribes, without any exact localization.">[168]</a> This statement
sounds not very trustworthy. We never hear of open battles,
in which fugitives would leave the camp unprotected. Besides,
even if affection would not bind them to the "fugitives,"
would fear of the stranger and enemy not act in this direction?
Little weight must be, therefore, attached to this evidence.</p>

<p>Taplin, about the Narrinyeri, says that sometimes the
treatment of women by their husbands is very bad; but this
is not always the case. "I have known as well-matched and
loving couples amongst the aborigines as I have amongst
Europeans."<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 12.">[169]</a> This last comparison shows that the ill-treatment
was not a clearly distinctive feature of the aboriginal
married life.</p>

<p>The Encounter Bay tribe (Narrinyeri) regarded the wives
<span class="pb" id="Pg71">[71]</span>
"more as slaves than in any other light."<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor" title="H. E. A. Meyer in Woods, p. 191.">[170]</a> This statement
implies lack of affection, absolute authority, and probably
bad treatment. Nevertheless, we cannot be content with such
a metaphorical and peremptory phrase on such an important
subject. It is, therefore, useless, and adduced only as an
example of how different and contradictory the statement of
even good informants may be.</p>

<p>We are told of a case, where a black woman of the Murrumbidgee
River tribe, who lived in marital relations with a white
bushranger, evinced for him the greatest affection and attachment,
and even several times helped him to escape justice
with great self-sacrifice. Although she was ill-treated by him
in the most brutal and revolting way, nothing could alter her
feelings.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor" title="Bennett, pp. 248, 249.">[171]</a> This example may serve as an illustration of how
attached a black woman may be to her husband, even if he
ill-treats her.</p>

<p>An account of the brutality of a woman's treatment is
given by Tench (referring to the Port Jackson blacks). "But,
indeed, the women are in all respects treated with savage
barbarity; condemned not only to carry the children, but all
other burthens, they meet in return for submission only with
blows, kicks, and every other mark of brutality."<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 199, 200.">[172]</a> But
Tench's statements do not appear to go very deeply below
the surface of superficial observations.</p>

<p>The same author in another place adduces the wounds and
scars of women as examples of "ill-treatment."<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 181.">[173]</a> How much
weight is to be attached to such an inference is well known,
after the explanation given by Spencer and Gillen.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor" title="Compare their statement below.">[174]</a> I adduce
this statement as one which is obviously unreliable, at the
same time being typical of a whole class of statements based
upon insufficient and superficial observations.</p>

<p>Interesting is what Turnbull says in his old account:
"The women appear to attach themselves faithfully to their
husbands thus chosen: they are exceedingly jealous of
them."<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor" title="Turnbull, J., p. 99 (concerning some tribes of New South Wales, probably of the neighbourhood of Port Jackson).">[175]</a></p>

<p>C. P. Hodgson,<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 217; compare p. 208.">[176]</a> speaking of some New South Wales tribes,
says that <i>gins</i> were slaves of their men and had all the drudgery
of camp. The misleading term "slave" is of little use to us.</p>

<p>According to Collins, in the Port Jackson tribes the father
enjoyed absolute authority over his family.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor" title="Collins, i. p. 544.">[177]</a></p>

Dr. John Fraser<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor" title="Abor. N.S.W., p. 2. This work is not written by a first-hand observer; I quote his opinion because the writer seems to have got sometimes good personal information, and to be an able compiler.">[178]</a> speaks of the bad treatment of the
woman by her husband amongst the natives of New South
Wales. Further he says: "In spite of the hardness of
their mode of life, married couples often live happily and
affectionately together...."<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 35.">[179]</a></p>

<p>G. W. Rusden writes:<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 283. The tribes in question are the Geawe Gal, New South Wales, Hunter River.">[180]</a> "... a man had power of life and
death over his wife." This asserts absolute authority; we
know, that as a rule, the man had not the power of death
over his wife unless she proved especially guilty.</p>

<p>Rob. Dawson relates of the Port Stephens blacks, that they
treated their wives very badly&mdash;with club and spear.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 66, 67.">[181]</a></p>

<p>Hodgkinson remarks that the women are better treated
in the River MacLeay tribes than among the other tribes he
had under observation.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 229.">[182]</a> This may point to a real difference
in the treatment of women among different tribes, or to
the fact that the other tribes which Hodgkinson might have
observed were nearer the settlements, and therefore more
degenerate.</p>

<p>As to the Euahlayi, Mrs. Parker remarks only: "In books
about blacks, you always read of the subjection of the women,
but I have seen henpecked black husbands."<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 58.">[183]</a> This statement,
which implies that bad treatment was not universal,
is inexact and therefore of little use.</p>

<p>We read about the Central Australian tribes of Finke
River: "Some married couples agree very well, live frequently
quite alone in solitude, and together provide for their
wants."<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor" title="L. Schultze, p. 237.">[184]</a> The wives are only ill-treated in case they elope.</p>

<p>"The women are certainly not treated usually with anything
which could be called excessive harshness" among the
Aruntas.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer &amp; Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 50.">[185]</a> Only in cases of infidelity "the treatment of the
woman is marked by brutal and often revolting severity."<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[186]</a>
The same is repeated of the Northern tribes of Central
Australia.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., pp. 32, 33.">[187]</a> We are also told that the scars that the majority
of women possess are due, not to the barbarity of their
husbands, but to the mourning ceremonies, during which the
women beat and wound themselves severely. And the authors
<span class="pb" id="Pg73">[73]</span>
conclude: "Taking everything into account, however, the life
of one of these savage women, judged from the point of view
of her requirements ... is far from being the miserable one
that it is so often pictured."<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 33.">[188]</a> For what would be a severe
pain to a white woman is for them merely a trifling discomfort.</p>

<p>We read in Barron Field, on the authority of two shipwrecked
men, who spent some time among the natives of
Moreton Bay, that the women are there usually well treated
by their husbands.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 66.">[189]</a></p>

<p>Another analogous statement is given on the Moreton Bay
tribes: "The wife is rather the drudge or slave, than the
companion of her husband." This (although badly formulated)
means bad treatment and lack of affection as well. But
we read further on that cruelty is perpetrated usually under
the effect of rum; this corroborates our supposition made
in connection with Lumholtz's statement. And we learn
yet: "but instances also of warm and deep affection are not
infrequent."<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor" title="J. D. Lang, p. 337.">[190]</a> And the author confirms it by an example.</p>

<p>Among the Kabi and Wakka: "Husbands were usually
affectionate to their wives, but when angered they were often
brutal, thrashing them unmercifully with waddies, sometimes
breaking their limbs and cracking their skulls. Still the
conjugal bond generally held out for a lifetime."<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor" title="J. Mathew, p. 153.">[191]</a></p>

<p>Lumholtz says: "The women are the humble servants
or rather slaves of the native."<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor" title="Lumholtz, p. 100.">[192]</a> The women are ill-treated
in the most cruel manner; he gives an example of a wife being
awfully maltreated for a trifle.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 161.">[193]</a> But this happened among
"civilized blacks." If she elopes she may be even killed.
But sometimes they are examples of loving couples.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 163.">[194]</a> In
another place we read of love and jealousy and of the great
affection they are capable of;<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 213.">[195]</a> and an example thereof is
given. This statement suggests to us that much of the ill-treatment
was due perhaps to the "civilization" of the blacks.</p>

<p>An analogous statement in this regard is given by Palmer,
concerning the tribes of Upper Flinders and Cloncurry River.
The lot of the women is hard and they are often treated with
club and spear. There are, nevertheless, happy and mutually
regardful couples.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor" title="Palmer, p. 28.">[196]</a></p>

<p>Roth says<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor" title="Bull. 8, p. 6.">[197]</a> that among the North-West Queensland tribes
the man has absolute authority over his wife. In another
place we are informed, that "in the case of a man killing his
<span class="pb" id="Pg74">[74]</span>
own gin, he has to deliver one of his own sisters" to be put to
death. And "... a wife has always her 'brothers' to look
after her interests." Thus, in some extreme cases, the
husband's authority seems to be limited by his wife's kindred,
who protect her.</p>

<p>The women among the Cape York natives are reported to
have a very hard life, but occasionally there exists a strong
attachment between a married couple.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor" title="Macgillivray, ii. pp. 8, 9.">[198]</a></p>

<p>In West Australia the man is said to possess a full and
inheritable right over his wife.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor" title="Grey, ii. p. 230.">[199]</a> Grey says that they have
very much to suffer, especially from the jealousy of their
masters.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 248, 249.">[200]</a> The authority of the husband appears also in the
story, told in Chapter XVII, where the husband inflicts a
severe beating on his two wives; nevertheless, he seems to
display also a certain affection for them and great care,
protecting them as far as possible.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Grey, ii. chap. xvii. p. 350, especially pp. 353, 354; point 3, p. 359.">[201]</a></p>

<p>We learn from Bishop Salvado that: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"La méthode qu'il</span>

barbarous modes of treatment are well known to us; what is
more important is the great fear they are said to have of their
husbands. But, in another place, the same author speaks of
tender and affectionate couples: "I love her and she loves
me"<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 278.">[204]</a> as a native said to him. So this statement seems not
so contradictory after all with all the others, although it
contradicts itself.</p>

<p>Among the natives of King George's Sound the women are
generally very ill-treated by their husbands. But in spite
of that they do not lack affection and often quarrel among
themselves, taking the part of their respective husbands.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor" title="Browne, p. 450.">[205]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we have a great diversity of statements and much
contradiction. We read of barbarous ill-treatment and
<span class="pb" id="Pg75">[75]</span>
of deep affection; of drudgery and slavery imposed on
wives, and of henpecked husbands; of fugitive men
having recourse to magic, and of women mercilessly
chastised, prostituted, and so on. Some statements
contradict themselves. All this shows, in the first place,
that our authors were lost in the diversity of facts and
could not give an adequate generalization, which should
picture for us the characteristic features of this relation
(between husband and wife) as they distinguish
it from the same relation in other societies. In fact, a
good characterization of a given phenomena can be
obtained only by comparing it with other phenomena of
the same kind found under different conditions. Otherwise
the observer will invariably note that aspect of the
phenomenon which struck him most strongly, and not
the one that is objectively the most characteristic, as is
found in the present case. This is the more evident in
that we do find a few statements (Howitt on Kurnai,
Spencer and Gillen's remark on the Central tribes,
J. Mathew), which contain all the apparently contradictory
elements found in the other statements, but
harmonized with one another. From these few consistent
statements it appears that, although the husband had
a nearly unlimited authority, and in some cases, when he
had special reasons (and undoubtedly deemed himself to
be within his rights), he might use his authority for a very
brutal and severe chastisement, nevertheless, there was
usually a mutual fondness and kindness. Taking this
picture as a standard, it is possible to understand and
make consistent all the other statements if we assume
that they exaggerate some of the traits of the general
picture.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor" title="Illustrating this point is a passage in Nieboer's Slavery (pp. 9 sqq.) bearing very closely on our subject. His aim is to discuss whether the position of the wife in Australia may be characterized as slavery. He arranges the evidence in two contrasting sets: in the first he gathers all shadows of the picture, in the second the bright spots. So he adduces several instances which show that the girl has no voice in the choice of her husband; ...">[206]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg76">[76]</span>
But we can make still better use of our evidence by
asking some definite questions and seeing how far we
get a clear answer to them. And we shall see that if,
in this way, the whole picture be analytically divided into
sections, the evidence will yield a quite unambiguous
answer on some important points concerning the relation
between man and wife in the Australian aboriginal
society.</p>

<p>The first inquiry is into the legal aspect of the husband's
authority. In accordance with our definition of "legal,"
we shall try to ascertain to what extent the relationship
of man and wife was left to follow its natural course;
at what point society interfered; and what form this
intervention assumed.</p>

<p>After the question of authority has been answered,
that of treatment will be dealt with. The legal authority
gives us only a knowledge of the limits which society set
to the husband's ill-treatment. But even if his freedom
went very far, and if he was not compelled from outside
to a certain standard of good treatment, he might feel
compelled to it by his own affection.</p>

<p>Therefore we are led, in the third place, to ask the
psychological question concerning mutual feelings between
<span class="pb" id="Pg77">[77]</span>
husband and wife. Affection is, of course, the
most important, fundamental characteristic of any intimate
personal relationship between two people. But it
is, at the same time, rather difficult to give any more
detailed answer on that point, when it is a question of
savages whom no one has intimately studied from this
point of view, and of whose psychology we have only a
very slight idea. More cannot be expected than to get an
answer to the quite general question: Is there anything
like affection between the consorts, or is their relation
based only on the fear of the woman of her husband? I
would also remark that these three points&mdash;affection,
treatment, and authority&mdash;although closely related, may
be separately analysed, as each of them is of a different
character: affection is a psychological, authority is a
social factor; the treatment, being a result of them both,
must be investigated separately, as we cannot foretell
from either of its components the form it will assume;
on the other hand, it is precisely from the treatment that
we can best judge of the affection.</p>

<p><em>1. Authority.</em>&mdash;It seems beyond doubt that in the
aboriginal society the husband exercised almost complete
authority over his wife; she was entirely in his
hands and he might ill-treat her, provided he did not kill
her. Out of our thirty statements, in six cases (Kurnai,
Bangerang, Lower Murray tribes, according to Bonney,
Geawe-Gal, Port Jackson tribes, North-west Central
Queenslanders) the absolute authority of the husband
is explicitly affirmed. We read in them either the
bare statement that the husband had an absolute power
over his family; or, in the better of them, we are
more exactly informed that he had only to abstain
from inflicting death on his wife. It was the latter's
kinsman who would avenge her (Kurnai, Bangerang,
North-west Central Queenslanders). It is difficult to
ascertain in what form society would interfere with
the husband if he transgressed the limits of his legal
authority, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> killed his wife. Curr informs us that the
<span class="pb" id="Pg78">[78]</span>
woman's relatives would avenge her death. Howitt
says that there would ensue a blood feud, which comes
nearly to the same. It is very probable that the woman's
kin retained some rights of protection.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor" title="Compare N. W. Thomas, p. 19.">[207]</a> The remaining
statements implicitly declare that the husband's
authority was very extensive. (Encounter Bay tribes
according to Meyer; New South Wales tribes according to
Hodgson; Port Stephens tribes according to R. Dawson;
Arunta; Herbert River tribes; Queenslanders according
to Palmer; Moreton Bay tribes according to J. D. Lang;
South-Western tribes according to Salvado; West
Australians according to Grey.) It is clear that wherever
we read of excessive harshness and bad treatment,
wounds, blows inflicted on women, the husband must
possess the authority to do it; in other words, he does
not find any social barrier preventing him from ill-treatment.
Especially as, in these statements, such ill-treatment
is mentioned to be the rule and not an exception.
In two statements we can gather no information on this
point. According to the statement of J. Dawson on the
West Victoria tribes, the husband's authority appears
strictly limited by the potential intervention of the chief,
who could even divorce the woman if she complained.
But Curr warns us against Dawson's information concerning
the chief and his power.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, A.R., i. p. 53 sqq.">[208]</a> Curr's arguments
appear to be very conclusive. Too much weight cannot
be attached, therefore, to Dawson's exceptional statement.
Discarding it, we see that we have on this point fairly
clear information. We may assume that society interfered
but seldom with the husband, in fact, only in the
extreme case of his killing his wife. Six statements are
directly, and the remainder indirectly, in favour of this
view, and the only one contradictory is not very trustworthy.</p>

<p>But is there nothing in this assumption that would
appear to contradict other well-established features of
<span class="pb" id="Pg79">[79]</span>
Australian social life? Against the husband's authority
there could only be the intervention of the Central Tribal
Authority or of the woman's kin. But the former was
not strong enough to enter into questions concerning the
private life of a married couple. The Tribal Government
probably had to deal only with grave offences against the
welfare of the whole tribe. And we never hear that it
interfered with any household questions. The woman's
kin, on the other hand, seems to have waived nearly all
its rights over the woman (compare also above what had
been said about the betrothal). Nevertheless, as mentioned
above, it was the woman's kin who eventually
intervened. It must also be borne in mind that as
marriages were, without exception, patrilocal,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor" title="See N. W. Thomas, p. 16.">[209]</a> the wife
was far away from her family, and, therefore, much less
likely to be protected by her relatives. And, as we shall
see below, when discussing the aboriginal mode of living,
the single families live in considerable isolation, so that
it would appear rather difficult to assume any intervention
from outside in matters of family life. It appears, therefore,
that all the circumstances on which family life
depends point very clearly to, and are in complete agreement
with, our assumption of a very extensive authority
of the husband over his wife (or wives), limited only in
some extreme cases by the kin of the woman.</p>

<p>2. Passing now to the other point: how far does the
husband make use of his power? in other words, how
does he usually <em>treat</em> his wife? Without entering more
in detail into the motives that regulate his conduct, it
is clear that even if we know his authority, we by no
means know how he usually used or misused it. Here
our impression when reading the evidence is undoubtedly
that the general way in which wives are treated in aboriginal
Australia is a very barbarous one. In fact, out of
our thirty statements, fourteen speak more or less explicitly
of barbarism, slavery, wounds and scars, etc.
Only seven assert that the average treatment is a fairly
<span class="pb" id="Pg80">[80]</span>
good one and that bad treatment is only a consequence
of certain trespasses, which are considered punishable and
consequently punished. The remaining nine statements
say that treatment is sometimes good, sometimes bad, or
do not say anything about the subject. But in this case
it is apparently needful to give a more careful consideration
of the quality of the information than of its quantity.
In fact, four<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Howitt, F. Bonney, and L. Schultze.">[210]</a> out of the seven of the authorities who
affirm good treatment are very clear and explicit, and
their statements are consequently quite consistent with
themselves; two of them are, besides, our best authorities.
Schultze and Bonney seem also in general to be quite
trustworthy. From the other part of our evidence (that
which asserts barbarous ill-treatment) only three are
fairly reliable (Curr, Salvado, and, to a certain extent,
Eyre). But even these are not so consistent with themselves:
they affirm, that in spite of the barbarous ill-treatment,
the women seem to be rather happy. If they
were happy as a rule, it means that this ill-treatment did
not appear to them cruel, and that they did not suffer
under its atrocity. Consequently that it was only
apparently bad (the same expression is used by Dawson,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>) in the eyes of the observers, and was not bad as
measured by the standard of native sensitiveness. The
statement of Spencer and Gillen confirms this view explicitly.
The statements affirming bad treatment (Curr,
Salvado, Eyre, etc.) do not distinguish the important
point whether this ill-treatment was a punishment or
not; whether it was inflicted only in definite cases where,
according to the unwritten tribal law, the wife was guilty
of an offence, or whether it was inflicted in fits of bad
temper and ungracious mood. This distinction is very
important; in the first case the husband would have only,
so to say, an executive power of the collective, customary
will, and his bad treatment would be only an act of
justice; in the second case he would have been a real
tyrant and his ill-treatment a mere act of brutality.
<span class="pb" id="Pg81">[81]</span>
This remark has also an important connection with the
problem of authority discussed above. Howitt's statement,
as well as Spencer and Gillen's, points very clearly
to the fact that the ill-treatment was only an act of justice
(from the aboriginal point of view). Mathew, on the
other hand, explicitly says that the ill-treatment was
caused by fits of anger. The other statements keep
silence on the point. Some of them speak, indeed, of a
purely arbitrary harshness without any reason, but this
refers to "civilized blacks," especially under the influence
of rum and other white man's vices.</p>

<p>There is a point that must not be forgotten in dealing
with this question. The majority of observations were
made on degenerated blacks (such as were in missions,
raised on farms, in the service of white men, etc.). These
blacks may have had quite different manners and customs
from those of the aborigines in their primitive state. And
their manners were not changed in the direction of
amelioration, but the reverse. This conclusion is corroborated
by an interesting passage in Howitt.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 777.">[211]</a> This
author says that examples of alleged contempt and
discourtesy of a man to his wife, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> a man gorging
himself with meat and throwing only a bone to his wife,
may be partly "the consequence of the 'new rule' under
the influence of civilization." They sometimes express
customary rules of magic origin and are no sign of contempt
at all. And the author adds that when he had
the opportunity of observing the blacks for a week in
more primitive conditions, "this week passed without a
single quarrel or dispute." This all shows that, in case
of contradiction, we may suppose that the statements
affirming unusual ill-treatment are affected by errors
due to bad material, insufficient observation, and false
inference, rather than that the statements of kindness
are exaggerated.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to note what effect the widespread
practice of exchange of relatives (see above) had
<span class="pb" id="Pg82">[82]</span>
on the treatment of wives. Naturally it might be
supposed that for his own sisters' (or relatives') sake
every man would probably be more lenient towards his
wife. But as Mr. Thomas justly pointed out, the exchange
of females may be conceived also in the light of a
certain family giving up its rights to a female, and
receiving another one in exchange.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 20.">[212]</a> It would be, therefore,
difficult to say anything <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> on this influence.
A phrase quoted by Curr suggests that the former assumption
would be nearer to truth. A black said once to him,
speaking about his sister given in exchange for his wife:
"If he beats my sister I shall beat my wife." Whether
this common-sense idea of justice prevailed in general in
the aboriginal mind it would be difficult to decide without
further knowledge. But possibly exchange of females
was also a cause of the amelioration of the woman's lot.</p>

<p>To sum up shortly, we have ten against four statements
in favour of indiscriminate ill-treatment of wives. But,
if we reduce both these figures by using only reliable ones,
we have four against three in favour of good treatment.
By closer analysis we find that ill-treatment is&mdash;in the
primitive state of the aboriginal society&mdash;in most cases
probably a form of regulated intra-family justice; and
that although the methods of treatment in general are
very harsh, still they are applied to much more resistant
natures and should not be measured by the standard of
our ideas and our nerves. For otherwise we should not
understand how the feature of happiness, which is reported
by nearly all our informants, could be present.</p>

<p>3. These considerations directly lead us up to an answer
to our last question, viz. whether there is a kind of
<em>mutual affection</em> or whether there is only the power of the
man, and the legal factors, that bind the consorts together.
In the first place, it is well to bear in mind that in this
respect there must have been a great variety of cases
corresponding to the characters of the individuals concerned.
We only ask here, therefore, the quite general
<span class="pb" id="Pg83">[83]</span>
question whether, as implied in some statements, there
was an absolute absence of any kind of personal feeling
in all Australian families and the wife considered her
husband as her master only and her natural enemy, she
being merely his slave. But here we find also that the
few statements (Curr, Eyre, Meyer, Mitchell) that imply
such an opinion are not very clear and explicit (in this
category we include all the statements as to slavery and
drudgery which can possibly embrace not only the treatment
itself but the underlying feelings); whereas there are
ten statements (Howitt, Bonney, Dawson, Lumholtz, J. D.
Lang, Salvado, Turnbull, Grey, Mathew, Macgillivray)<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor" title="For examples of conjugal affection see also an article written by a 'bushman' and one of the members of Leichhard's Expedition. Science of Man, 1904, p. 47.">[213]</a>
which affirm that there is real affection between husband
and wife. Some of them come from our most reliable
writers and are very explicit (Howitt, Bonney, Lumholtz,
Salvado). As what has been said of the treatment refers
indirectly to this point (for treatment is regulated by
personal feelings and not by tribal authority), we may
say that the assumption of a complete lack of any
feelings of affection or attachment does not seem very
plausible. That these feelings would show themselves in
another way than in our society seems beyond doubt. But
that they would be completely absent and their places
taken only by fear and awe&mdash;that is not in agreement with
our evidence. Even judging on this question <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>,
we could hardly suppose that there would be a complete
absence of all factors that tend to create mutual affection
between consorts. In the first place we may remember
that in many cases the motive of sexual love was not
absent from the aboriginal marriages. This was apparently
always the case in marriages by elopement,
which occurred in all tribes and was, under certain conditions,
a legal and recognized form of contracting
marriage. In the cases when, following infant betrothal
and other circumstances, the husband was much older
<span class="pb" id="Pg84">[84]</span>
than his wife, the motive of sexual love was probably not
reciprocal, but it would operate as a cause for more tender
feelings on the part of the males. In the second place,
it must be remembered that there are no reasons why the
blacks should be completely alien to the feelings of
attachment. Husband and wife lived more or less completely
separated from the community, forming a more
or less isolated unit (see below, <a href="#Pg132">on the mode of living</a>).
They had many interests in common, and, this being the
strongest bond, they had common children to whom they
were usually much attached.</p>

<p>To sum up this chapter, it may be said that the husband
had a well-nigh complete authority over his wife; that
he treated her in harmony with the low standard of
culture, harshly, but not excessively harshly; that
apparently the more tender feelings of love, affection and
attachment were not entirely absent from the aboriginal
household. But it must be added that, on these two last
points, the information is contradictory and insufficient.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Mourning and Burial Ceremonies</span></h4>

<p>Among the duties and obligations which determine the
relationship of husband and wife, there are some which
may be mentioned in this place. I mean the customs and
rites connected with mourning. Mourning expresses a
whole complex of feelings and ideas, of which two sets
are important here, inasmuch as they throw light upon the
relationship of the mourner and the mourned. Firstly,
mourning always expresses sorrow and grief (real or
feigned) for the deceased; secondly, the various mourning
ceremonies imply the idea that there was a strong tie between
the two persons involved, a tie which persists after
death and which must be broken by the magical virtue
of rites.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Levy Bruhl, p. 389.">[214]</a> Both these interpretations of mourning (sorrow
<span class="pb" id="Pg85">[85]</span>
for the deceased and the necessity of breaking the bond)
involve the idea that the relationship between husband
and wife was acknowledged by society as an individual
and strong personal tie. As the modes of obtaining wives
have shown us that to bring about a marriage it was
necessary to get the sanction of society; so the long
mourning of the widow and the different formalities she
has to perform, before she becomes the property of the
dead man's heir or is allowed to remarry, show that
marriage was not dissolved at once, even by the death
of the man. It shows, therefore, that the tie between
husband and wife was not a loose one, and not merely
established by the fact of possession or cohabitation;
and that the appropriation was based not only on legal
ideas, but deeply rooted in magico-religious feelings and
representations.</p>

<p>The idea that mourning is performed in order to express
sorrow, apart from its being obvious in the ceremonies
themselves, is realized and formulated by the natives.
When a very old and decrepit woman dies, or an old man
who has lost his memory and is useless in tribal matters,
the natives do not perform any elaborate ceremonies.
They allege as a reason that they "do not feel enough
sorrow for them."<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, on the Central and North Central tribes (more especially the Kaitish and Unmatjera), Nor. Tr., p. 506.">[215]</a></p>

<p>Ceremonies involving the motive of sorrow are mentioned
in several places by Spencer and Gillen. Among
the Arunta, "when a man dies his special <i>Unawa</i> or
<i>Unawas</i> smear their hair, faces and breasts with white
pipeclay and remain silent for a certain time until a
ceremony called <i>Aralkililima</i> has been performed."<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 500.">[216]</a>
The widow has a special name. In some of the northern
tribes she has to keep silence. <i>E. g.</i> "Among the Warramunga
... the widows are not allowed to speak for
sometimes as long a period as twelve months, during the
whole of which time they communicate only by means
<span class="pb" id="Pg86">[86]</span>
of gesture language."<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 500. Compare also Nor. Tr., p. 525.">[217]</a> Among the Arunta the widow
has to live in the woman's camp and suspend, to a large
extent, her usual occupations.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., pp. 501, 502.">[218]</a> When she wishes the
ban of silence to be removed, she has to perform a ceremony
in public, which consists in the main in an offering
of vegetable food to the younger brother and sons of the
deceased. "The meaning of this ceremony, as symbolized
by the gathering of the tubers or grass seed, is
that the widow is about to resume the ordinary occupations
of a woman's life, which have been to a large extent
suspended, while she remained in camp in what we may
call deep mourning."<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 502.">[219]</a> Analogous ceremonies of nearly the
same duration and involving similar ordeals and privations,
are in use in some other tribes: among the Kaitish
and Unmatjera the widow has her hair cut off, she has
to smear her body over with ashes, during the whole time
that mourning lasts, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> several months, she has also to
keep silence.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 507.">[220]</a> Amongst all these tribes the women
inflict upon themselves the most cruel wounds. "The
women seem to work themselves up into a perfect frenzy,
and to become quite careless as to the way in which they
cut and hack themselves about, with, however, this
restriction notable on all such occasions, that however
frenzied they apparently become, no vital part is injured,
the cutting being confined to such parts as the shoulders,
scalp, and legs."<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 510.">[221]</a> The authors give a detailed description
of such ordeals undergone by two widows of deceased
men in the Warramunga tribe. "The actual widow
scores her scalp with a red-hot firestick."<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., pp. 521 sqq.">[222]</a></p>

<p>Taking mourning customs as a measure of the intensity
of sorrow and grief, it may be seen that here these feelings
are supposed to be very strong, as the hardship and ordeals
are very great. Of course, there is no question of individual
feelings. The widow may be in some cases really
glad that her husband has died, as well in Australia as
<span class="pb" id="Pg87">[87]</span>
in any of our modern societies. What is shown at any
rate is, that society supposes and requires such feelings,
and that they are duties according to the social moral
code; in fact, that sorrow and grief for the deceased are
required by the collective ideas and feelings. Whether
these feelings are displayed in order to appease the spirit
of the deceased, whether there is real sorrow as a basis
for these customs, these are questions irrelevant in this
place.</p>

<p>Probably many different motives contributed to form
the mourning rites and duties, as they are now in existence.
These duties have in Australia apparently not
merely a customary, but also a legal character. For we
read in Spencer and Gillen: "a younger brother meeting
the wife of a dead elder brother out in the bush, performing
the ordinary duties of a woman, such as hunting for
'yams,' within a short time of her husband's death,
would be quite justified in spearing her."<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 502.">[223]</a> And, again,
it is said in another place, that if a woman would not
comply with the severe ordeal which is her duty, "she
is liable to be severely chastised or even killed by her
brother."<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 522.">[224]</a></p>

<p>Whatever more special explanation might be attempted
of all these laws and customs it is certain that they
express the fact that the marital bonds are very lasting.
The obligations last after the death of the husband,
and expiation must be made for the eventual
new union. For Spencer and Gillen give a detailed
account of all the complex formalities and duties to be
performed before the widow can remarry, or rather is
given up to the younger brother of the deceased, to whom
she belongs by law.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor" title="Levirate; see above, p. 63.">[225]</a> After the performance of several
ceremonies and a long lapse of time, she may still, if she
likes, paint a narrow white band on her forehead, which
is regarded as an intimation that she is not anxious to
marry at present, as she still mourns, though to a less
<span class="pb" id="Pg88">[88]</span>
degree than before, for the dead man.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 507.">[226]</a> "The spirit of
the dead man was supposed to have been watching
all these proceedings as he lay at the bottom of the
grave."<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[227]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately the other authors do not give anything
approaching Spencer and Gillen's full account of burial
and mourning. In particular, if there is any description,
the actual and tribal relatives are not differentiated. All
that I have adduced here from Spencer and Gillen refers
to the actual widow. A short remark of Roth may be
quoted: "In the Boulia district when a man dies, his
nearer relatives have special mourning performances.
These nearer relatives, in the case of an adult male, are
considered to be the <em>wife</em> and his brother and sisters by
the same mother, not his father or mother; with an
adult woman, only the brothers and sisters by the same
mother."<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor" title="Roth, p. 164.">[228]</a> Amongst the Dieri, "a widow is not permitted
to speak until the whole of the white clay which
forms her 'mourning' has come off without assistance"
(perhaps some months).<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, p. 724.">[229]</a> There is also a statement about
the husband's mourning. Amongst the Victorian tribes,
"when a married woman dies and her body is burned,
the husband puts her pounded calcined bones into a little
opossum skin bag, which he carries in front of his chest
until he marries again, or until the bag is worn out."</p>

<p>To sum up, it may be said, that as far as Spencer and
Gillen's evidence may be taken as typical of what burial
and mourning is in Australia, the legal and customary
aspects of the marriage bonds is not less strongly expressed
in the way in which they are dissolved, than it is in the
way in which they are brought about.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class="pb" id="Pg89">[89]</span>
<small>SEXUAL ASPECT OF MARRIAGE</small></h2>

<p>The next point in our investigation is the sexual
aspect of the Australian marriage. Unfortunately it
will not be much easier to draw a decisive inference from
the evidence in this case than it was in the foregoing one.
There is perhaps less patent contradiction between the
statements; and we are able here to reduce many of the
incongruities to geographical differences. But the whole
question is very complicated by the fact that the sexual
features of marital life in Australia have caused much
discussion in connection with the hypothesis of primitive
promiscuity and group marriage. They have been very
often interpreted according to this hypothesis. Different
customs have been pointed out as unmistakable survivals
of previous states of marital communism or group marriage.
Group marriage has even been said to be in actual
existence amongst some tribes.</p>

<p>In accordance with our opening statement, polemics
will be strictly avoided here, particularly in reference to
questions of prehistory; and, therefore, we need not
concern ourselves with the problem whether certain facts
point to the previous existence of group marriage or
promiscuity; nor with the problem whether certain
features are survivals of a similar state of things.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor" title="The solution of this problem would, in the first place, require a revision of the concept of survival, in order to avoid arbitrariness when classifying one custom as a survival, another as an innovation. I venture to say such classifications have been made too carelessly. I think it will be clear from the whole of this book, that the individual family should not be considered as a mere innovation, and that, accordingly, there is hardly any justification or treating the customs in question as survivals. ...">[230]</a> Highly
<span class="pb" id="Pg90">[90]</span>
objectionable from our point of view, however, is the fact
that our best informants (especially Howitt and Spencer
and Gillen) describe the facts of sexual life of to-day in
terms of their hypothetical assumptions. To gain, therefore,
a clear picture of the actual state of things we shall
have to disintegrate all that is hypothetic in the statements
from the actual facts.</p>

<p>That is the first reason why it will be necessary to
submit here and there the statements to some discussion.
But there is another reason. Being concerned with the
problem of the individual family and individual relationship,
we must keep in mind that although the sexual aspect
of family life is very important, nevertheless, it is only
one side of the picture, and that to outline this picture
correctly, we may not exaggerate one side of it. Now, by
a quite illegitimate silent assumption, the sexual features
are often treated as the most important&mdash;in some cases
as the exclusive factors of marriage. But marriage, as
we saw and shall have the opportunity to see still more
clearly, is rooted in all the manifold facts that constitute
the family life: mode of living, economics of the household,
and above all the relation of the parents to their
children. Unless it is proved, therefore, that the unity of
family life and the individuality of the family break down
on all these points, no general inference as to group
marriage can be drawn from the mere facts of sexual
communism. In other words, sexual licence is nothing
like group marriage. How far we have the right to infer
the <em>actual</em> existence of group marriage (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i> group family)
from sexual facts in Australia, must therefore be discussed
now, while we are concerned with the sexual aspect
of the Australian family.</p>

<p>I wish to make it quite clear that any discussion upon
our evidence will be carried out merely with the aim of
<span class="pb" id="Pg91">[91]</span>
getting a clear picture of the actual state of things. It
is not our task to polemize with the general theories as
to the previous state of things, origin of family, etc., set
forth by our authors. For a criticism of Howitt's, and
Spencer and Gillen's speculations on the origin of marriage,
the reader may be referred to the excellent chapter in
Mr. Thomas's work. This criticism seems to me to leave
no doubts that the general views expounded by the ethnographers
mentioned above are hardly founded on any of
the Australian facts. These views are mere hypotheses,
drawn theoretically from facts. Personal knowledge of
these latter could hardly have enabled the ethnologists
to theorize more correctly on them. From Mr. Thomas's
criticism it results also, that it is no exaggeration to
say that the continual application of these hypotheses
to the actual state of things considerably obscures the
clearness and value of their evidence. It is necessary
to add, nevertheless, that Howitt especially always gives
very first-rate information concerning family life, the
institution of marriage, etc.; and, according to my view,
his theories are contradicted by the excellent and admirably
rich information he himself gives on social matters.
If we can seldom agree with him as speculative sociologist,
we always admire him in his ethnographic research.</p>

<p>The following statements are intended to give an account
of all the features of sexual life in Australia, especially as
far as they bear upon family life. We shall, therefore, in
the first place pay attention to the way in which sexual
intercourse is limited and determined by marriage. Are
the marital relations the exclusive right and privilege of
the husband? Or has he only a certain over-right, modified
by some other factors (which we must endeavour to
determine). Or is there (at least in some tribes) really
a sort of group marriage (using the word "marriage" to
designate mainly the sexual side of it)? In the second
place we must also pay some attention to the more general
questions of chastity, licence before marriage, and so on.
And finally, the features of the interesting and important
<span class="pb" id="Pg92">[92]</span>
forms of ceremonial and regulated licence must be traced
more in detail.</p>

<p><i>Statements.</i>&mdash;Amongst the Kurnai "the husband expected
strict fidelity from his wife, but he did not admit any reciprocal
obligation on his part towards her."<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Kam. and Kurn., p. 205.">[231]</a> ... "The expected
fidelity towards the husband was enforced by severe penalties.
In cases of elopement her life was in his hands.... Each
man not only expected his wife to be faithful to himself, but
he, on his part, never lent her to a friend or to a guest."<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 202, Latin footnote; p. 205.">[232]</a> In
another place,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor" title="Smith. Rep., 1883, p. 810.">[233]</a> Howitt says, about the same tribe, that sometimes
wives were exchanged "by order of the old men" to
avert some impending danger to the tribe. We see that with
these rare exceptions, the husband had quite exclusive sexual
rights over a woman. Even the general practice of wife-lending
seems to have been entirely absent. Now, as Howitt is a
strong adherent of the theory of group marriage, we may
accept his statements asserting individuality of "marriage"
as especially trustworthy.</p>

<p>Amongst the Murring<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[234]</a> "the only occurrence of licence is
when a visitor from a distance is provided with a temporary
wife by the hosts.... In cases of elopement, when the woman
is captured, she becomes for a time the common property of
the pursuers. With these exceptions, marriage seems to me
strictly individual."<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor" title="As Howitt uses the term 'marriage' to denote only its sexual side, we must understand that sexual rights are strictly individual.">[235]</a> (We see that here again Howitt speaks
of individual marriage where there are only, in fact, individual
sexual rights.) The only exceptions were here, wife-lending
to visitors and the characteristic form of punishment.</p>

<p>Curr says:<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor" title="A.R., i. p. 109. This may be considered as trustworthy only in reference to the North Victorian tribes, especially the Bangerang, whom Curr had under personal observation.">[236]</a> "Amongst Australians there is no community
of women. The husband is the absolute owner of his wife (or
wives)." He is very jealous and "usually assumes that his
wife has been unfaithful to him, whenever there has been an
opportunity for criminality; hence the laws with respect to
women are very stringent." A woman is completely isolated.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor" title="See below, Chap. V.">[237]</a>
The husband will, nevertheless, often "prostitute his wife to
his brothers" or visitors.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor" title="A.R., i. p. 110.">[238]</a> Here we see the same: the man
<span class="pb" id="Pg93">[93]</span>
can dispose of his wife (the term prostitute is here probably
used rather in rhetoric sense, for it does not seem that the man
would receive any direct contribution for wife-lending); but
he is very jealous in all cases where anything might happen
behind his back.</p>

<p>On the West Victorian aborigines Dawson writes<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 28.">[239]</a> that
illegitimate children were rare, and the mother was severely
beaten, sometimes even put to death, by the relatives. "The
father of the child is also punished with the greatest severity
and occasionally killed." The woman's relatives do not even
accept his presents as expiation. "Exchange<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor" title="He doesn't say if temporary or permanent exchange. Probably the first, as he speaks below of divorce.">[240]</a> of wives is
permitted only after the death of their parents and, of course,
with the consent of the chiefs, but is not allowed if either of
the women has children." What is said about illegitimate
children, would point to sexual morality before marriage.
But we can hardly conceive how in a society, where females
are handed over to their husbands, often before, and at the
latest at reaching puberty, there could be illegitimate children
at all. The whole statement is not clear.</p>

<p>Beveridge<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 23.">[241]</a> says of the aborigines of Victoria and Riverina:
"Chastity is quite unknown amongst them." "In their
sexual intercourse ... they are not in the least bit particular,
consequently incest of every grade is continually being
perpetrated."<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor" title="This assertion of incest is quite in contradiction with all we know about Australians and undoubtedly false; it may be true in the case of quite 'civilized' blacks, perhaps. I quote it as an instance of how, from one statement only, one might draw absolutely false conclusions.">[242]</a></p>

<p>"Among the Wotjobaluk it was not usual for men to have
more than one wife, and they were very strict in requiring
fidelity from her, and did not lend a wife to a friend or to a
visitor from a distance." Death was the punishment for both
the wife and her accomplice in case of adultery.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 245.">[243]</a> According
to this statement not only fidelity is required in this tribe, but
even chastity is known as a virtue. This seems rather exaggerated,
and as it is given only by a correspondent of Howitt, we
shall not attach to it too much weight. Nevertheless, this, in
agreement with all our other statements on Victoria, shows
that the standard of sexual morality could not be very low
there, as we might infer from the foregoing statement.</p>

<p>"Marriage is not looked upon as any pledge of chastity,
<span class="pb" id="Pg94">[94]</span>
indeed, no such virtue is recognized." And in a Latin footnote
the author enumerates the proofs: promiscuity of unmarried
people; wife-lending and exchange; general ceremonial
licence.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor" title="Eyre, ii. p. 320, about the Lower Murray River tribes.">[244]</a> But the Adelaide tribes were much degenerated,
and possibly some customs relate to the Lake Eyre tribes,
with whom the author was also acquainted.</p>

<p>J. Moore Davis<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor" title="Brough Smyth, ii. p. 319. This statement (and the whole article) does not refer to any single tribe; there are mentioned tribes from all over the continent.">[245]</a> speaks in a Latin passage of the licence at
corroborees and of the rights of access enjoyed by old men at
the initiation of the girls. The statement is not localized.</p>

<p>Among the Narrinyeri, youths during initiation are allowed
unrestricted sexual licence.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor" title="Taplin, loc. cit., p. 18.">[246]</a></p>

<p>In the Turra tribe: "Women were bound to be faithful to
their husbands, also the husbands to their wives. Whoever
was guilty of unfaithfulness was liable to be punished by
death at the hands of the class of the offender."<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor" title="Yorke Peninsula, Kühn, loc. cit., p. 286.">[247]</a> This
statement is very clear; but if it is equally correct it reports
quite an exceptional state of things.</p>

<p>Schürmann writes about the Port Lincoln tribes: "Although
the men are capable of fierce jealousy, if their wives transgress
unknown to them, yet they frequently send them out
to other parties, or exchange with a friend for a night; and
as for near relatives, such as brothers, it may almost be
said that they have their wives in common."<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 222, 223.">[248]</a> But does this
community of wives refer merely to sexual matters? It is
probably so, as the author mentions it in connection with the
general description of this side of aboriginal life.</p>

<p>C. Wilhelmi writes about the same tribes: "Although the
men are apt to become passionately jealous if they detect
their wives transgressing without their consent, yet of their
own accord they offer them and send them to other men, or
make an exchange for a night with some one of their friends.
Of relatives, brothers in particular, it may be said that they
possess their wives jointly."<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor" title="Ch. Wilhelmi, p. 180.">[249]</a> This statement and the foregoing
can hardly be looked upon as independent; for Wilhelmi
knew the missionary Schürmann personally, and had from him
a good deal of his information; the two statements are almost
literally identical.</p>

<p>Amongst the Yerkla Mining tribes: "A wife is bound to
be faithful to her husband." She is severely punished; if
<span class="pb" id="Pg95">[95]</span>
successively guilty, killed.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 258.">[250]</a> Women are lent, but very
seldom.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[251]</a></p>

<p>A. L. P. Cameron reports some cases of sexual licence among
the Darling River tribes. They used to exchange wives
"either at some grand assembly of the tribe, or in order to
avert some threatened calamity." But the author adds,
"This custom is, I think, rare at present."<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 353.">[252]</a> At any rate, we
may bracket this statement with that of Howitt, who also
speaks of wife exchange, in order to avert impending calamity.</p>

<p>Charles Wilkes writes, that jealousy is very strongly
developed among the New South Wales blacks. From it
originate occasional quarrels, and the women suffer especially
from jealousy and suspicions. There are also regulated fights
and ordeals in order to settle quarrels and enmities ensuing
from sexual matters.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit. (smaller edition), i., p. 226.">[253]</a></p>

<p>Tench mentions the sexual licence of unmarried girls among
the Port Jackson tribes.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 199.">[254]</a></p>

<p>We read about the natives of Botany Bay, that the men
were very jealous.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor" title="Phillip, pp. 34, 35.">[255]</a></p>

<p>Turnbull says, that quarrels arise usually from jealousy
in sexual matters. The affair usually becomes more general
and involves the whole tribe.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 90, 99. Tribes of New South Wales, probably from the neighbourhood of Sydney.">[256]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Geawe Gal there were probably occasions
on which "promiscuous intercourse (subject to the class rules)
took place."<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor" title="Rusden, loc. cit., p. 281.">[257]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Kamilaroi "the punishment for adultery was,
that when a woman was <i>taramu</i>, that is, shifty, wanton,
adulterous, the husband complained to his kindred, who
carried the matter before the headman, and if the charge was
found to be true, her punishment was to be taken without the
camp and to be handed over to all comers for that night, and
her cries were not heeded."<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor" title="C. E. Doyle in Howitt's Nat. Tr., pp. 207, 208.">[258]</a> Women were lent to friends,
visitors, but with their own consent.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[259]</a> This statement
confirms again the majority of those relating to the South-east
tribes. The husband did not tolerate any trespass in these
matters; and the community intervened. On the other hand,
he had (with her consent) the right to dispose of her.</p>

<p>Amongst the Euahlayi: "There are two codes of morals,
one for men and one for women. Old Testament morality for
<span class="pb" id="Pg96">[96]</span>
men, New Testament for women."<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor" title="Mrs. Parker, p. 58.">[260]</a> This applies, probably,
chiefly to sexual matters, for we read in another place,<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 59.">[261]</a>
"Unchaste men were punished terribly.... The death penalty
for wantonness was enforced." Also a girl "found guilty of
frailty" is severely punished by her relatives.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 60.">[262]</a> An "absolute
wanton" is ignominiously treated, the result being
almost inevitably death.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[263]</a> This statement is incomplete, as
we are not told if adultery and wantonness are punished
only when they are perpetrated without knowledge of the
husband; in other words, we are not informed if the widespread
custom of wife-lending was absent or not among the
Euahlayi.</p>

<p>Amongst the Dieri there was besides the regular Tippa
Malku marriage, the occasional <i>Pirrauru</i> relation. The
sexual intercourse of the latter was confined to some festival
or to the case when the Tippa Malku husband was absent.
The number of <i>Pirraurus</i> of each man was limited, and they
were strictly assigned to each other. There was sexual
jealousy amongst the <i>Pirraurus</i>. The husband had, apparently,
the right to decline the use of his wife to any <i>Pirrauru</i>.
The <i>Pirrauru</i> relation will be discussed more in detail below.
The custom of wife-lending is prevalent: "continually their
wives are lent for prostitution, the husband receiving
presents."<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor" title="J.A.I., xxiv. p. 170. Gason in answer to Prof. Frazer's 'Questions.'">[264]</a> It may be noted, that this is the only place
where wife-lending is stated to take this form. Besides, we
are informed by Howitt that the unmarried girls and widows
were allowed a considerable amount of sexual freedom, this
custom being called <i>Ngura-mundu</i>.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 187.">[265]</a></p>

<p>The Urabunna, living in the neighbourhood of the Dieri,
had an institution analogous to the <i>Pirrauru</i> custom. Besides
his <i>Nupa</i> or individual wives, of whom he might possess one
or two, who were "specially attached to him and lived with
him in his own camp," he could have several <i>Piraungarus</i>
to whom he had "access under certain conditions."<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 109.">[266]</a> (But
we are not informed what these conditions are; we may infer,
however, that they are analogous to those existing among the
Dieri, which we know in detail: see below.) Our authors inform
us further that the <i>Piraungarus</i> "are to be found
living grouped together."<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor" title="Idem, Nor. Tr., pp. 72, 73.">[267]</a> We shall discuss below this
<i>Piraungaru</i> relation more in detail.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg97">[97]</span>
Amongst the Arunta nation, there are different occasions
on which men besides the husband have sexual access to the
woman. There are the customs at the "initiation" of the
girls.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., chap. iii. pp. 92-96; and Nor. Tr., chap. iv., pp. 133 sqq. About these ceremonies, some words were said above, pp. 42, 43, in connection with marriage ceremonies.">[268]</a> And there are many cases in which the husband is
compelled by custom to waive his rights on behalf of some
one else; such instances generally happen in connection with
ceremonial gatherings.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., pp. 96, 97.">[269]</a> It is important to note that on
these occasions men have access to women with whom it
would be most criminal for them to have intercourse under
normal conditions; and a man may cohabit even with his
mother-in-law, from whom he is under normal conditions
absolutely isolated.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 97, and Nor. Tr., p. 137. The features of these ceremonial licences will be discussed more in detail below.">[270]</a></p>

<p>The ceremonies of initiation of girls in Central Australia, and
sexual promiscuity connected with them, are also mentioned
by W. H. Willshire. Women after initiation are sexually
"at the mercy of all who may get hold of them."<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 30.">[271]</a> The
same author mentions also the sexual "immorality" of
the natives in question.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 36.">[272]</a> This raw statement, although
inadequately formulated, corroborates Spencer and Gillen's
exact data.</p>

<p>Analogously in the Northern tribes there are several
exceptions from the individuality of sexual relations. The
man may lend his wife to his friends or to people whose
favour he wishes to gain. There are customs at the initiation
of girls, when several men, standing to the girl in a certain
group (tribal) relationship, have access to her. In the third
place there is the sexual licence connected with certain ceremonies,
when men are obliged to cede their wives to some of
their tribesmen.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nor. Tr., chap. iv. pp. 133 sqq.">[273]</a> And we read the description of the most
horrid atrocities which men inflict as punishments upon their
unfaithful wives.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor" title="Idem, Nor. Tr., p. 474.">[274]</a> We read in the same place that the
charming away of women by magic was one of the chief
sources of fights and quarrels. About sexual jealousy in the
Central and Northern tribes, we read: "Now and again if a
husband thinks that his wife has been unfaithful to him, she
will certainly meet with exceedingly cruel treatment."<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 33.">[275]</a></p>

<p>We are informed about the existence of the practice of
<span class="pb" id="Pg98">[98]</span>
exchange of wives among the Northern tribes (Port Darwin,
Powell's Creek) in the answers to Prof. Frazer's "Questions."<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor" title="J.A.I., xxiv. p. 178.">[276]</a></p>

<p>J. D. Lang says about the aborigines of Queensland, that
the "conjugal relations are maintained with great decency."
But he mentions the custom of wife-lending.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 237.">[277]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Maryborough tribes, sexual licence is allowed
before marriage and there is a camp of unmarried girls.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 232.">[278]</a>
Many, however, "remain perfectly virtuous until their promised
husband fetches them."<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 233.">[279]</a> Women who were wanton after
their marriage "are looked down upon as the prostitutes of the
tribe, and are lent to visitors as temporary wives."<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[280]</a> Here
chastity seems to be not so strongly required. But the statement
is somewhat odd as regards the camp of unmarried girls.</p>

<p>Amongst the Kabi and Wakka tribes (Queensland, near
Maryborough), there are cases where the "seniors of the
camp" have some rights over a woman. In general none
but the husband had any matrimonial "rights over the wife,
and the jealousy made him take good care she was not interfered
with, unless he was a consenting party."<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor" title="J. Mathew, pp. 161, 162.">[281]</a> Here we
have again the characteristic feature: the husband had
exclusive sexual rights over his wife; but he might dispose
of her, and used to do so.</p>

<p>Amongst the North-west Central Queensland aborigines<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor" title="Roth, Bull. 8, p. 7, § 3.">[282]</a>
there is a certain licence before marriage "unless they should
happen to be betrothed"; in that case the husband does not
like it. "Morality in its broadest sense is recognized a
virtue." And in another place we are informed that "if an
aboriginal requires a woman temporarily, he either borrows
a wife from her husband for a night or two in exchange for
boomerangs, a shield, food, etc., or else violates the female
when unprotected, when away from the camp, out in the bush."
In the latter case, if the woman is unmarried "no one troubles
himself about the matter." If married, a quarrel would ensue
if the husband came to know anything.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor" title="Idem, Ethnol. Stud., p. 182, § 327.">[283]</a> Roth gives also an
account of the initiation ceremonies, in which females, arrived
at puberty, are ceremonially deflorated by old men. It is
important to note that the exogamous class rule is disregarded
on such occasions, when several men of forbidden
degrees have access to the woman, but blood relations are
strictly excluded. A girl acquires a new designation, corresponding
<span class="pb" id="Pg99">[99]</span>
to the new age grade; she becomes marriageable
and enters altogether into a new status.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor" title="Ethnol. Stud., pp. 174 sqq.">[284]</a></p>

<p>Among the natives of Cape York the unmarried girls are
allowed to have free intercourse, but a female once married
is required to be absolutely faithful to her husband, and this
requirement is enforced by severe punishments.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor" title="Macgillivray, ii. p. 8.">[285]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the tribes of West Australia: "The crime of
adultery is punished severely&mdash;often by death."<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor" title="Grey, ii. p. 242.">[286]</a> Grey
speaks also of the "stern and vigilant jealousy."<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 252; also see p. 248.">[287]</a> "... the
bare suspicion of infidelity upon their part is enough to
ensure to them the most cruel and brutal treatment."<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 249.">[288]</a>
But he mentions also the continuous rows and plots
that issue round a beautiful woman,<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 248, 249.">[289]</a> who knows sometimes
how to evade the precautions of her husband. Grey
speaks emphatically of the "horror of incest."<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 242.">[290]</a> Fidelity
seems, therefore, to be severely enforced in these tribes. Grey
says nothing about wife-lending. Chastity does not seem to
have obtained there, nevertheless.</p>

<p>We read in Oldfield, about the West Australian tribes,
that there was an "initiation" ceremony before a female was
considered fit for marriage; in it "all the males of the tribe"
partook. Women sometimes betray their husbands.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 251. The tribes in question are those of the Murchison district.">[291]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. D. M. Bates reports, that among the tribes of West
Australia she had under observation, there exists a "certain
tribal morality" and "bad or loose living women (according
to their ideas) occupied much the same status in a certain
degree as our unfortunate sisters do amongst us." There
were even contemptuous names for women of bad conduct.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 51.">[292]</a>
Unfortunately, this statement says absolutely nothing of
what would be the most interesting thing to know, viz. the
ideas of the natives about sexual matters, in other words, the
code of the "tribal morality." Here, besides the fidelity
which was strictly required, a complete chastity is affirmed.
On the whole it seems to agree roughly with Grey's and
Salvado's statements; he also does not mention any regulated
licence. As our information on West Australia is so scanty,
we can hardly decide whether sex morality stands there much
higher than in the Central and North-eastern peoples; but as
we have reason to regard both the information of Grey and
of Salvado as trustworthy and accurate, we may assume that
this difference actually existed.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg100">[100]</span>
Similarly Bishop Salvado speaks of the great jealousy of
the natives of South-west Australia and of their morality.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Le sauvage ne pardonne jamais l'insulte faite à la pudeur
des femmes qui lui appartiennent; c'est un outrage qui se

<p>Scott Nind informs us about the natives of King George's
Sound, that "infidelity is by no means uncommon. The
husband keeps a jealous eye on his wife, and on the least
excuse for suspicion she is severely punished."<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 39.">[295]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reviewing this material, the first thing to be noted
is a considerable geographical variety of custom and law
in sexual matters. There are clear and radical differences
between the South-eastern tribes, the South Central,
North Central, and Northern Queensland tribes. The
views on sexual morality apparently differ as much as
the actual practices. Whereas in Victoria, South-eastern
New South Wales, and the Southern territory of South
Australia there are no traces of regulated licence, or at
least not in a very conspicuous form&mdash;in the South
Central tribes the features of <i>Pirrauru</i> relations; in the
Central and North Central different forms of ceremonial
licence are highly developed, and play an important part
in tribal life. In Queensland there does not seem to
exist such a very strict sexual morality, as far as we
can gather from our statements. Our five statements
from West Australia do not give a very clear picture.
Undoubtedly these geographical differences, as here indicated,
must be conceived as merely rough approximations.
There are too many contradictions between the statements
concerning the South-eastern area; the data as to
Queensland and West Australia are too few and vague to
allow anything beyond mere generalities. But broadly,
as is indicated above, these local differences undoubtedly
exist.</p>

<p>Besides the data contained in the statements there
<span class="pb" id="Pg101">[101]</span>
is, to confirm this view, the opinion of A. W. Howitt.
In his article on the tribal and social organization in
Australia, this writer directly points out the radical
differences existing between the South Central and the
South-eastern tribes in sexual matters; and as he knew
from personal acquaintance or from reliable informants
the whole area, we may consider this geographical
difference as thoroughly established.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor" title="See Smith. Rep. for 1883, pp. 804 sqq. Chap. iv. on 'Marital groups,' p. 810, and Trans. R.S.V., pp. 115 sqq.">[296]</a></p>

<p>Let us now draw some general conclusions from the
evidence. The points selected at the outset for special
attention were: first, the problem of the rights, privileges,
and restrictions of the husband in sexual matters; second,
the question how is chastity in general, considered and
valued? third, a survey of the cases of ceremonial or
regulated licence.</p>

<p>1. The first question may be broadly answered by saying
that the husband had in general a definite sexual "over-right"
over his wife, which secured to him the privilege
of disposing of his wife, or at least of exercising a certain
control over her conduct in sexual matters. In some cases
this over-right amounted to quite an exclusive right, which
even in some exceptional tribes was never waived.
We read of cases where the husband was not only never
compelled by custom, or any other social force, to dispose
of his wife, but apparently never did it on his own impulse.
In these cases we may say that the absolute faithfulness
of a married woman was enforced, and that her chastity
was recognized as a virtue. (Wotjobaluk, Turra, and the
South-western tribes according to Salvado.) Besides there
are several other statements, from which it appears that
the sexual rights of the husband were nearly exclusive,
and that he was not inclined to waive these rights in
order to derive therefrom any personal profit. So among
the Kurnai there was no wife-lending nor any other similar
custom, and wives were exchanged only in quite exceptional
cases in order to avert impending evil. The same
<span class="pb" id="Pg102">[102]</span>
is asserted in Cameron's statement. Among the Yerkla
Mining women are but seldom lent. Mrs. Parker writes
that wantonness was considered a crime among the
Euahlayi, and nearly the same has been said by Mrs.
Bates about the West Australians. Roth speaks of
morality in a broad sense. Grey and Macgillivray write
that women were expected to be strictly faithful to their
husbands. But in these two last cases we do not know
whether lending or exchange of wives was entirely absent,
or is only not mentioned by the authors. All the statements
which affirm strict and vigilant jealousy, without
further analysis, leave the question open as to whether
the husband ever allowed adultery to his wife, or whether
he punished it only when perpetrated without his consent.
But interpreting these statements according to the other
more detailed ones, it may be said that in general, such
exclusiveness of marital rights and appreciation of chastity
seem rather to be an exception; and some caution
must be used in accepting the above-mentioned cases
of absolute faithfulness and chastity required from
married women. As a rule, even where there is not regulated
licence, wife lending and exchange, hospitality, etc.,
seem to be more or less practised.</p>

<p>In the majority of statements these customs are found
in one form or the other; in these cases we cannot speak
of an absolute fidelity or exclusive individual sexual right
of the husband. We read in fifteen of our thirty-eight statements
of the customs of wife-lending or exchange; and in
twelve some form of sexual licence is mentioned. But in all
these cases, where the woman is given away, this is done
with the consent and generally on the initiative of her
husband, who in the majority of cases derived some benefit
from the transaction.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor" title="It is to be mentioned that we find an indication in a few statements that fidelity was binding only on the female, the males considering themselves free from any obligation (Howitt's statement on the Kurnai, and Mrs. Parker's statement on the Euahlayi.) This holds good, probably, in all the tribes.">[297]</a> Exchange of wives obviously
implies an advantage to the husbands. The same must
<span class="pb" id="Pg103">[103]</span>
be assumed in the case of hospitality and wife-lending
when the courtesy of the husband presupposes a reward
in one form or another. In the case of ceremonial licence
as related by Spencer and Gillen, wife-lending is always a
kind of retribution for religious services. Payment of this
nature occurs also for other services, and may be used as
bribery towards an avenging party.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor" title="See below, page 107.">[298]</a> The husband always
disposes of his wife, who is never allowed to take the first
step in this matter, and it is consequently he who benefits
from her conduct. This conduct does not seem punishable
or wrong in any sense to the native mind. Quite
otherwise is it with the woman who trespasses without
the sanction of custom or without her husband's approval.
In all such cases she is considered culpable and more
or less severely punished. This is directly stated by
Shürmann and Wilhelmi, and appears in nearly all the
other statements.</p>

<p>The punishment dealt out in cases of elopement was
discussed above in connection with the mode of obtaining
wives. We saw that as a rule the punishment is severe.
Sometimes the kindred of the offended party (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> the
husband) help him to punish the offender; sometimes the
whole local group takes his side. Several of our statements
assert that in cases of elopement, the woman when
caught becomes the common property of all her pursuers,
and that afterwards she has to undergo severe punishment
(Kurnai, Murray tribes). In some statements we read
that adultery is punished with death (Wotjobaluk, Turra,
Kamilaroi, Euahlayi, South-western tribes); in others,
that the punishment for adultery or even a suspicion of it
is very cruel (Curr, Spencer and Gillen, J. Mathew, Grey).
It appears, therefore, that the husband is very careful
about maintaining his over-right over the sexual life of his
spouse. He very often has to submit to some customary
practices, and often subordinates his wife to some private
aim; but he must always give the initiative, or at least
have the sexual life of his wife under his control.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg104">[104]</span>
2. In the second place a word about the chastity of the
unmarried women is necessary. Here we may remark
at the outset that this question seems relatively unimportant,
as we know that girls are handed over to their
promised husbands on arriving at puberty, or even before.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor" title="Comp. Chap. II., and Chap. VII. p. 257.">[299]</a>
On the other hand, it seems hardly probable that girls
would have sexual intercourse in their extreme youth
(that is, before being married); during this period, girls
are continually under the control of both parents, and
especially of the mother, and as it will appear from the
statements referring to the "bachelors' camp," it is probable
that males and females are kept apart from each
other before reaching puberty.</p>

<p>That girls had no sexual intercourse before marriage is
also suggested by the custom of "initiating" girls by the
old men, which takes place immediately before they are
handed over to their husbands. From the detailed
descriptions of Spencer and Gillen and W. E. Roth it
appears that at this initiation girls are deflowered (Central,
North Central and Central Queensland tribes).<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., chap. iii., and Nor. Tr., chap. iv. Roth, Ethnol. Stud., p. 174, § 305.">[300]</a> On the
other hand, the custom of levirate&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> of handing over
the widow to the deceased's brother or nearest relative&mdash;seems
to be very widespread (compare above, <a href="#Pg63">page 63</a>);
so that there are hardly any marriageable and unmarried
widows in the aboriginal society. Accordingly we find
but little indication of any misconduct in the case of
unmarried females, and the few instances we meet with
are so little detailed that they do not throw much
light upon this question; it is especially uncertain
whether they are exceptional innovations, or whether
they have any more serious social <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d'être</i>. It is
mentioned that there exists an unmarried girls' camp
with sexual licence (Maryborough tribes, see below, <a href="#Pg266">p. 266</a>).
Roth mentions that unmarried girls are free in their
conduct as long as they are not promised in marriage.
<span class="pb" id="Pg105">[105]</span>
We read of a similar freedom in the Dieri tribe, as also in
the statements of Tench and Macgillivray. The most
important form of licence before marriage seems to be,
therefore, the practice of initiation just mentioned.</p>

<p>Speaking now of chastity in general, and summing up
both what was said under the first and the second heading,
it may be affirmed that it is not considered in the light of a
necessary virtue. Before marriage the girl has to submit
to a general sexual intercourse, and after it the woman
becomes on many occasions the property of another man.
This refers more especially to the tribes described by
Spencer and Gillen and Roth. It was said at the outset
that a much stricter morality seems to have prevailed in
the South-eastern tribes, although there, too, we read of
sexual licence (during initiation among the Narrinyeri,
and in general, according to Beveridge and Moore Davis).
But as it was there possibly much more rarely practised&mdash;we
are informed by our very best source, Howitt, about
several tribes, that they knew and practised chastity
(Kurnai, Turra, Wotjobaluk, etc.)&mdash;we may keep to the
geographical distinction.</p>

<p>3. Let us in the third place speak more in detail about
customary and ceremonial licence, as it merits for many
reasons our special attention. Here belong, besides the
ceremonial defloration of girls by old men (just spoken
of), the different forms of licence practised at large tribal
gatherings, and especially the <i>Pirrauru</i> relationship, found
in several of the South Central tribes.</p>

<p>Besides the exact and detailed data about ceremonial (or
ritual) defloration that are given by Spencer and Gillen and
Roth, these ceremonies are mentioned also by Willshire,
Beveridge, Moore Davis, Mathew, and Oldfield. But the
short notes of those latter authors are hardly sufficient to
allow any further discussion; they may be considered as a
confirmation of the more exact evidence, but the latter,
and especially Spencer and Gillen's data, must serve as
material for all analyses. These ceremonies, on the one
hand, seem to correspond to the initiation ceremonies of
<span class="pb" id="Pg106">[106]</span>
the males. It is only in this light that they are represented
by Roth, who does not mention any close connection between
these ceremonies and marriage, but represents them
as the condition of marriageability. The said ceremonies
possess, as a matter of fact, many points of analogy with
the male initiation ceremonies. They are performed on
arrival at puberty; Roth states that the girl then acquires
a new name and new status. The operation performed
then upon the initiated is also to some extent analogous
in both cases.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor" title="See Spencer and Gillen, Nor. Tr., p. 133, where this is explicitly mentioned. The names of both ceremonies in the Arunta seem to indicate this analogy; atna--ariltha--kuma and pura--ariltha--kuma (for their meaning see the place just quoted).">[301]</a> On the other hand Spencer and Gillen
represent these ceremonies as directly connected with
marriage. What the underlying ideas in this connection
are, it is difficult to say. It has been suggested that such
ceremonies express a kind of expiation for marriage.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor" title="Idem, p. 96, apply this concept, due to Lord Avebury, to this special case.">[302]</a>
But as this idea is not directly embodied in this institution,
and as it is not necessarily a condition of its existence,
and, moreover, as it has not been directly affirmed by the
natives, it may be treated merely as an assumption.</p>

<p>A very important and striking feature of ceremonial
licence in general, is that the sexual intercourse, which
takes place on that occasion, is not subject to class rules.
We are indebted to Messrs. Spencer and Gillen for a
very minute account of customary licence, which takes
place as a rule during corroborees and other ceremonies.
"In the Eastern and North-eastern parts of the Arunta,
and in the Kaitish, Iliaura and Warramunga tribes, considerable
licence is allowed on certain occasions, when a
large number of men and women are gathered together
to perform certain corroborees. When an important
one of these is held, it occupies perhaps ten days or a
fortnight, and during that time the men, and especially
the elder ones, but by no means exclusively these, spend
the day in camp preparing decorations to be used during
<span class="pb" id="Pg107">[107]</span>
the evening. Every day two or three women are told
off to attend at the corroboree ground, and with the
exception of men who stand in the relation to them of
actual father, brother, or sons, they are, for the time being,
common property to all the men present on the corroboree
ground."<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., pp. 96, 97.">[303]</a> On all such occasions the class rules are
disregarded, they are even broken, so to say, in the most
radical way: a man may have, in connection with certain
performances, access to his mother-in-law, who under
normal conditions is most strictly tabooed to him.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor" title="See ibid., pp. 96-99 (for the Arunta tribe).">[304]</a>
And again, in the Warramunga tribe an example is
quoted when a tribal father has access to his tribal
daughter on ceremonial occasions.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 138.">[305]</a> This example refers
to a case where the woman was offered by her husband as
a kind of retribution for some services rendered in performance
of ceremonial functions. In the same tribe
there are other occasions (in connection with burial) on
which a man is bound by custom to offer his wife to a man
who was useful to him.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 139.">[306]</a> The class rule is disregarded in
such cases, too. This holds good also in the case when a
man receives this form of reward for having been useful
to the community as a messenger.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[307]</a> When an armed
avenging party is sent to carry out a sentence on some
other local group, the latter may attempt to bribe the
members of the avenging party by offering them some
women. If these are accepted, the sentence is not carried
out, and the avenging party returns peacefully home.
Sexual intercourse under this condition is also not subject
to the class rule.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 140.">[308]</a> It may be said, therefore, that on all
occasions<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor" title="The Pirrauru custom excepted.">[309]</a> when ceremonial licence takes place, the strict
class exogamy does not hold good; whereas incest, as regards
blood relationship, is always strictly forbidden. This
refers both to the initiation rites and to ceremonial licence
in the tribes described by Roth and by Spencer and Gillen.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg108">[108]</span>
In this place a somewhat extensive digression concerning
the <i>Pirrauru</i> custom must be made. This question
plays such an important part in all speculations about a
former state of group marriage, and it is undoubtedly such
an interesting fact by itself, that it would be impossible
not to give here an account at least of its most essential
features. The custom in question consists in the fact,
that in certain of the South-east Central tribes a man and
a woman are put into a relationship which involves
occasional sexual connection and some other mutual
rights and obligations, to be discussed in detail below.
This custom is found in the tribes living North, South and
East of the Lake Eyre, the Urabunna, the Dieri, Yantruwunta,<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor" title="For a detailed enumeration and description of all tribes among whom practices of the Pirrauru type exist, see Howitt, J.A.I., xx. pp. 31-34. In this article, which is nearly exactly reproduced in Howitt's last work (Nat. Tr.), we possess, undoubtedly, the best information about the Pirrauru custom. In another place (Folk-Lore, xviii. p. 184), Howitt assigns a still wider area to the Pirrauru practice. ...">[310]</a>
and other kindred tribes. We know the most
about the Dieri, whom Howitt chooses and represents as
a typical example of all these tribes, and whose <i>Pirrauru</i>
practices in his opinion differ only slightly from those
of the neighbouring tribes. This is important, for our
knowledge about the Dieri practices is much more ample
than in the case of any other tribe; and it does not
agree in all particulars with what we are told about the
Urabunna by Spencer and Gillen.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor" title="We have reasons to doubt whether these authors were as well informed about the Urabunna tribe as about the Arunta nation. Anyhow, the information they give about the Piraungaru custom is much inferior as well in respect of quantity as quality (the inconsistency of their statement is shown above) than that about the Arunta, and the conclusions they draw therefrom are not quite in accord with the facts as they relate them (see below, p. 118).">[311]</a> We shall, therefore,
<span class="pb" id="Pg109">[109]</span>
rely in the first place upon the information given about
the Dieri by Howitt, Gason, and Siebert, and in our
general view of the <i>Pirrauru</i> we shall be guided by this
information.</p>

<p>It is first to be noted that the custom in question exists
side by side with individual marriage. We find this
expressly stated in three places by Howitt.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor" title="J.A.I., xx. p. 53, Smith. Rep., p. 807, Trans. R.S.V., p. 100. In J.A.I., xx. p. 53, Howitt says that among all these tribes there are two forms of marriage. 'There is a marriage ... which may be spoken of as 'individual marriage.'' 'There is also a marital relation existing between a man and a number of women, or between a woman and number of men. This latter connection may be spoken of as group marriage.' ...">[312]</a> But besides
these merely verbal assertions of authorities, we have
much better proofs of the assertion in the facts related
by them concerning the <i>Pirrauru</i> customs. From these
facts it clearly appears that individual marriage existed
quite independently of the <i>Pirrauru</i> relation, and that it
was even only slightly affected by this relation. We shall
enumerate the most important features of the <i>Pirrauru</i>
custom of which we are informed, occasionally remarking
under each heading what is the difference between
marriage and the <i>Pirrauru</i> relation. It will appear that
many of the factors that constitute marriage are completely
absent in that relation, and that others play in
each quite a different rôle.</p>

<p>1. In the first place, let us ask how was the <i>Pirrauru</i>
relation brought about. We are informed that on the
occasion of large tribal gatherings such as corroborees,
invitation gatherings, etc., when the whole tribe was
present, the old men and the heads of the totems, assembled
in camp council, decide which men and women
<span class="pb" id="Pg110">[110]</span>
should be allotted to each other. The result of this
decision is then publicly announced.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, J.A.I., xx. p. 56. Smith. Rep., p. 807.">[313]</a> Now we know<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor" title="See above, p. 41.">[314]</a> that
the individual or Tippa Malku marriage is brought about
in quite a different way: the girl is promised as an
infant to her future husband. Such an infant betrothal
is usually accompanied by exchange of females; and
the decision lies in the hands of the girl's family (her
mother's brother). We see that the mode of obtaining
the individual Tippa Malku wife is quite different from
the way in which the <i>Pirrauru</i> relationship is established;
and we see also that the latter does not show any of the
characteristics which enforce and express the individual
character of marriage.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it has its legal aspect, for it rests on the
authority of the camp council of old men, which seems to
be the only form of tribal authority known in these tribes.
The old men seem also to keep an eye on the <i>Pirrauru</i> connections
in their subsequent course (see below under <a href="#n5">5</a>).
These relations, therefore, bear, thanks to this sanction of
the tribal elders, the character of validity and legality,
and are to a certain degree compulsory. (How far they
are compulsory in the case of the husband of the allotted
woman, see below under <a href="#n6">6</a>); but they involve neither the
mutual obligation of two families, nor a period of long
engagement, nor any factors expressing collective ideas
of the individuality of mutual appropriation of a man and
a woman.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor" title="Collective ideas which closely correspond to our ideas of monogamy, of monopolization of the marital rights and relationship in the widest sense of the word; special stress being laid on the point, that by the word 'marital' relations I do not mean sexual relations, either exclusively or even in the first place.">[315]</a></p>

<p>There are still two points connected with this heading
which emphasize the difference between the individual
marriage and the <i>Pirrauru</i> relation,<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor" title="Points to which attention was drawn by Mr. N. W. Thomas, loc. cit., p. 129.">[316]</a> namely that individual
marriage must precede <i>Pirrauru</i> relations; in
<span class="pb" id="Pg111">[111]</span>
other words, that only married women may be made
<i>Pirraurus</i>. Secondly, that although any woman may
have only one Tippa Malku husband (men may have
several Tippa Malku wives), she may have several <i>Pirraurus</i>.
This very point induced many writers to consider
the <i>Pirrauru</i> as a form of group marriage.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 187. J.A.I., xx. p. 56. Spencer and Gillen, Nor. Tr., p. 73; Nat. Tr., p. 64. Howitt, Smith. Rep., p. 197.">[317]</a> That this
relation bears a group-character is beyond doubt. That
it must be clearly distinguished from marriage is just what
we try to show here.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor" title="The same was argued from a different point of view by Mr. N. W. Thomas, loc. cit., pp. 127 sqq.">[318]</a></p>

<p>2. Another interesting point about the <i>Pirrauru</i>, is
that no consent of the parties is asked.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor" title="J.A.I., xx. p. 56.">[319]</a> But this appears,
according to other data, to hold strictly good only as far
as the woman is concerned. For we are told<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., pp. 181, 187.">[320]</a> in another
place that a woman's wishes are not taken into account
unless through the mediation of her husband. Hence
it seems that on one side a man's wishes may be taken into
account, and on the other side a man may even dispose
of his own wife. This points to the fact that a husband's
consent or mediation when his wife is concerned may be of
some weight. The same conclusion results from the fact
(already noticed by Mr. Thomas in this connection) that
two men may eventually exchange their wives in connection
with the <i>Pirrauru</i> custom.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 181, 182, 187.">[321]</a> All this appears quite
plausible if we bear in mind that<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor" title="See below, pp. 255 sqq.">[322]</a> the old men keep the
greatest number of females for themselves&mdash;at least all
the most comely ones. And that these very men have
afterwards the right of disposing of their wives. They
will, on the one hand, exchange some of the females with
each other; on the other hand, they will allot perhaps
some of their wives to one or another of the
young men living in celibacy. In fact, we read that very
often old and renowned warriors give their wives to some
<span class="pb" id="Pg112">[112]</span>
youngster, who regards it as a great honour.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt says, explicitly (Nat. Tr., p. 184), that 'the leading men in the tribe have usually more Tippa Malku and Pirrauru wives than other men.' The Pinnaru, Jalina Piramurana had over a dozen wives, and to get one of them as Pirrauru was a great honour for a man.">[323]</a> In conclusion
it appears probable that the man had a voice in
the choice of his <i>Pirrauru</i> or had not, according to his
personal influence. As to the woman, it was her husband's
part to decide, or at least to influence the opinion of the
camp council. But statements are not clear on this
point, and we are left here to a great extent to our own
conjectures.</p>

<p>3. From the foregoing, it results that the husband still
retains some over-right and control over his wife. And
that is a very important point. For in the light of this
fact, the waiving of sexual privileges connected with the
<i>Pirrauru</i> custom does not appear to encroach any more on
the husband's right to his wife than the custom of wife-exchange
or wife-lending. This fact of the necessity of
the husband's consent is confirmed by Howitt's explicit
statement. We read<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor" title="J.A.I., xx. p. 56; Nat. Tr., p. 184; Smith. Rep., p. 807, under 5.">[324]</a> that a man has right of access to
his <i>Pirrauru</i> only during the absence of her husband or,
if the latter were present in camp, only with his consent.
It is evident, therefore, that the husband's rights are by no
means annihilated or superseded by the <i>Pirrauru's</i> rights.
He waives his rights voluntarily, and his consent is
essential.</p>

<p>4. Another point of importance is that this relationship
does not constitute a permanent status, and that it may be
actualized only at intervals. In the first place, the sexual
licence involved in this custom is exercised during the
tribal gathering, for the night in which the assignation of
<i>Pirraurus</i> took place; the licence lasts for about four
hours.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor" title="J.A.I., xx. p. 56.">[325]</a> This relation is probably renewed during
some of the next gatherings; during the husband's
absence; when a man is sent on an embassy with his
<span class="pb" id="Pg113">[113]</span>
<i>Pirraurus</i>; in some cases where the husband gives his
consent. But although none of our sources say so
expressly, we may safely deny the assertion that the
<i>Pirrauru</i> relation had a permanent status. For, if it
were actually valid and exercised permanently, we would
not be informed, as we are, as to the special occasions on
which it takes place, and of the conditions under which it
may be exercised. Again, if the <i>Pirrauru</i> involved a
permanent status or, more explicitly, if groups of men and
women who are <i>Pirraurus</i> to each other respectively,
normally and permanently live in marital relations, no
one of our authorities, who plead so strongly for the
character of group marriage in the relation in
question, would omit to emphasize such an important
feature, which would support their views in the highest
degree. For this is a crucial question indeed: if the
<i>Pirrauru</i> right entitles, in the first place, only to a short
licence and establishes permanently merely a facultative
right, then, even in its sexual aspect, it does not approach
the rights established by Tippa Malku marriage in these
tribes. And, although the evidence on this point is not
quite decisive, we are, as we saw, entitled to suppose that
the sexual licence connected with the <i>Pirrauru</i> is only an
occasional one.</p>

<p>Besides the facts and reasons enumerated above,
I may adduce a very important passage from Howitt's
last work, which may be considered the ultimate opinion
of this eminent ethnographer concerning the problem
of group marriage in Australia&mdash;a hypothesis of which
he always has been a most ardent supporter. "A study
of the evidence which has been detailed in the last
chapter has led me to the conclusion that the state of
society among the early Australians was that of an
Undivided Commune. Taking this as a postulate, the
influence on marriage and descent of the class division,
the sub-classes and the totems may be considered on the
assumption that there was once an Undivided Commune.
It is, however, well to guard this expression. I do not
<span class="pb" id="Pg114">[114]</span>
desire to imply necessarily the existence of complete and
continuous communism between the sexes. The character
of the country, the necessity of moving from one spot
to another in search of game and vegetable food, would
cause any Undivided Commune, when it assumed dimensions
greater than the immediate locality could provide
with food, to break up into two or more communes of the
same character. In addition to this it is clear, after a
long acquaintance with the Australian savage, that in the
past, as now, individual likes and dislikes must have
existed; so that, admitting the existence of common rights
between the members of the Commune, these rights would
remain in abeyance, so far as the separated parts of the
Commune were concerned. But at certain gatherings,
such as Bunya-bunya harvest in Queensland, or on great
ceremonial occasions, all the segments of the original
community would reunite. In short, so far as the evidence
goes at present, I think that the probable condition of the
Undivided Commune may be considered to be represented
by what occurs on certain occasions when the modified
Communes of the Lake Eyre tribes reunite."<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., pp. 173, 174, beginning of chap. v.">[326]</a></p>

<p>This shows that after a long and mature consideration
of the problems in question, Howitt came to the conclusion
that "group marriage" never could have existed
as a permanent status, and that it could have been established
only in connection with large tribal gatherings.
In such a light the hypothesis of former or even actual
"group marriage" becomes very plausible, or rather
it ceases to be a hypothesis and it becomes one of the best
established facts of the Australian ethnology.</p>

<p>But at the same time, although we may accord the term
"group marriage" (if any one wishes at any price to retain
it), we must note that such a state of things is radically
different from marriage in the usual sense of the word,
and in particular from marriage as found in actual existence
in the Australian aboriginal society, and described
in this study. It will be sufficient to point out that such
<span class="pb" id="Pg115">[115]</span>
an occasional sexual licence lasting several hours during
an initiation gathering could not create any bonds of
family, such as may result from community of daily life
and community of interests, common inhabiting of the
same dwelling, common eating, especially common rearing
of children&mdash;all factors which, as will be shown below, act
only in the individual family and tend to make out of the
individual family a well-established and well-defined unit.</p>

<p>We must adduce one fact which stands in opposition
to what is just said. I mean the statement of Spencer
and Gillen, that amongst the Urabunna the Piraungarus
are "generally found living grouped together." This
statement might possibly point first to a permanent
state of marital relations, secondly to a common mode
of living. Now it may be remarked that such an offhand
statement on such a crucial point shows undoubtedly
that the authors were insufficiently informed themselves
on this point, and that, therefore, we must accept this
statement with the utmost caution.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor" title="Compare above, p. 108, note 2.">[327]</a></p>

<p>The problem of the mode of living of the <i>Pirrauru</i>
groups involves two questions&mdash;first, what persons constituted
the local group (temporary or permanent); and
second, how the members of a <i>Pirrauru</i> group lived within
it. The statement of Spencer and Gillen may mean that
a group of <i>Pirraurus</i> constituted a given temporary local
group. But within this group husband and wife must have
formed a distinct unit. Now as to the question of how far
such a grouping of <i>Pirraurus</i> (if we accept the above
statement as correct) would imply a permanent marital
status between the <i>Pirraurus</i>, it is impossible to answer.
On this point, too, the information about the Urabunna is
vague and defective, and it is safer to base our conclusions
on the more explicit and reliable material given by Howitt
in the case of the Dieri.</p>

<p><a name="n5" id="n5">5.</a> Did the <i>Pirrauru</i> union last for the whole life, or
could it be dissolved? In one place we read that the
relation in question lasts for life; in another place we are
<span class="pb" id="Pg116">[116]</span>
told<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 182.">[328]</a> that the old men watch over the <i>Pirraurus</i> in order
that there may result no trouble from mutual jealousy;
and if a man has too many <i>Pirraurus</i> they compel or
advise him to limit himself to one or two. No answer can
be given, therefore, to this question.</p>

<p><a name="n6" id="n6">6.</a> We mentioned above that if the <i>Pirrauru</i> relation,
according to Howitt's supposition there quoted, only
involved sexual licence during big tribal gatherings, this
relation would be absolutely deprived of any of the
characters that are the chief constituents of marriage and
family. But here we must indicate that such an assumption
is not quite justifiable. In fact, in some of the facts
related about the <i>Pirraurus</i>, there are hints pointing to
the existence of economic bonds and of community in
daily life between <i>Pirraurus</i>. We read<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor" title="Idem, J.A.I., xx. p. 57.">[329]</a> that if in the
absence of her husband a woman lives with one or two
of her <i>Pirraurus</i>, she occupies with them one hut and
shares with them the food. Therefore, in the absence
of her husband, a <i>Pirrauru</i> actually took his place, and
in this case the <i>Pirrauru</i> relationship is not merely a sexual
connection, but it assumes the real form of marriage.
In another place<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 58.">[330]</a> we read that a man possessing several
<i>Pirraurus</i> may lend one of them to some one who is
deprived of this advantage. Thus it seems that the
<i>Pirraurus</i> acquire a kind of real right over their <i>Pirrauru</i>
wives; and that it goes as far as the faculty of disposing
of them. And again we are informed that if a woman
has a young man for a <i>Pirrauru</i> she is often jealous of
him and looks strictly after him, and if he does not
obey her readily enough, tries even to compel him by
punishment.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 183.">[331]</a> All these instances, which could perhaps
be further multiplied, show that under certain circumstances,
which we unfortunately do not know with
sufficient precision, the <i>Pirrauru</i> relationship assumes a
much more serious character than a mere sexual licence
exercised during a few hours.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg117">[117]</span>
<a name="n7" id="n7">7</a>. There remains still to examine what form the
relationship of children to parents assumes in the tribes
where the <i>Pirrauru</i> relationship exists. Here we are
quite well informed that the individual relation between
the children of a woman and both their parents (their
mother and her Tippa Malku husband) is fully recognized
by the aborigines. It is true that Spencer and Gillen say
that there is only a "closer tie" between the married
couple and their children, and that the children acknowledge
the <i>Pirraurus</i> of their parents as parents.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor" title="See below, p. 243.">[332]</a> But this
statement is very unsatisfactory; such a complicated
question cannot be answered by a short phrase; for we
are by no means aware what the words "closer tie"
mean. As unsatisfactory is Howitt's remark, that owing
to the promiscuous sexual intercourse, no woman can
know if the children are the offspring of her husband
or of the <i>Pirraurus</i>, and, therefore, the children must be
considered as possessing group fathers and not individual
fathers.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor" title="J.A.I., xx. p. 58.">[333]</a> Apart from the objection that this applies
merely to paternity and not to motherhood, which would
remain at any rate individual, we must point to our
subsequent investigations, which will show that the
physiological question of actual procreation does not
play a very important part in the determination of
relationship. Probably it does not play in these tribes
any part at all, as they (at least the Urabunna) seem
not to have any knowledge of the actual physiological
process of procreation. So we see that although both
Howitt and Spencer and Gillen try to prove the existence
of group relationship between the <i>Pirraurus</i> and their
children, their conclusions appear to be ill founded in
facts, and to be rather the fruits of speculation than of
observation. Our suspicions are strengthened by the unsophisticated
remark of Gason, to which we must ascribe
much weight, as he knows the Dieri tribe better than
any one else, and as he has no theory of his own to prove
or to demolish. He says: "The offspring of the <i>pirraoora</i>
<span class="pb" id="Pg118">[118]</span>
are affectionately looked after and recognized as if they
were the natural offspring of the real husband and wife."
Although this phrase is not very happily formulated, its
meaning appears to be that the married couple recognize
all the children of the woman and treat them with kindness
and affection, without making any distinction. If,
according to the views just mentioned, the children were
accepted by all the men cohabiting with a given woman,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> by her husband and all the <i>Pirraurus</i>, the phrase
quoted above would be obviously quite meaningless; for
why should the offspring be recognized as if they were the
husband's own children in order to be treated well? It
may also be pointed out that the Dieri father is very
affectionate to his children.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor" title="See below, pp. 195, 238 and 243.">[334]</a> And in all the statements
referring to this subject we clearly see that it is a question
merely of the individual father and by no means of a
group of fathers.</p>

<p>After this survey of what appear to me to be the most
important points referring to the <i>Pirrauru</i> custom, we
see that nearly each one of them is involved in contradictions
and obscurities. To draw any general conclusion
we must proceed with the utmost care and precaution.
Our information about <i>Piraungaru</i> of the Urabunna is
nearly worthless. And we may safely repeat with
Mr. Thomas, that if the authors knew more facts and
knew them better than we can do from their description,
then perhaps their conclusions, drawn from these unknown
facts, may be correct; but if they draw their
general conclusions only from the facts they communicate
to us, then we are justified in rejecting them.</p>

<p>Our chief aim in discussing the features of the <i>Pirrauru</i>
relationship was to ascertain how far this relation possesses
the character of marriage. That it is a "group relation"
is beyond doubt.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor" title="Compare, however, the definition given by N.W. Thomas, loc. cit., p. 128, who shows also how misleading an indiscriminate use of such terms may be.">[335]</a> That it is a form of marriage has been
<span class="pb" id="Pg119">[119]</span>
accepted by Howitt, Fison, and Spencer and Gillen without
much discussion.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor" title="And some others. For instance, Prof. Frazer in his new work, loc. cit., i. pp. 363 sqq., where the theories and views of these authorities on Pirrauru are accepted without any criticism.">[336]</a> Mr. Thomas has shown already how
unsatisfactory the reasons are, on the strength of which
<i>Pirrauru</i> is considered to be a form of group marriage,
or even a survival of the previous stage of group marriage.
He has shown how insufficient, in the light of an exact
definition, the information is, how many essential points
we still want to know to be able to make any more conclusive
assertion. Mr. Thomas' criticism bears especially
on the lack of a strict use of the term "group marriage."
He gives a correct definition (page 128 of the work quoted)
of this term, and consistently puts to its test the views
propounded by the previously mentioned writers. From
this discussion he concludes that in the <i>Pirrauru</i> relationship
we can find neither the features of an actual group
marriage nor the traces of such a previous state of things.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 136.">[337]</a>
This criticism and conclusion appear to me so convincing
and final, that I would have simply referred to them
without entering again upon this rather perplexing
question, were it not a good opportunity for pointing out
again by means of this example, that the sexual aspects
of marriage and the family cannot be discussed separately,
detached from each other; and for showing how incorrect
it is to represent the sexual side of marital life as the complete
and unique content of marriage. On the contrary,
marriage may not be, as so often repeated here, detached
from family life; it is defined in all its aspects by the
problems of the economic unity of the family, of the
bonds created by common life in one wurley, through the
common rearing of, and affection towards, the offspring.
In the above points I tried to show that in nearly all
these respects the <i>Pirrauru</i> relationship essentially
differs from marriage and cannot, therefore, seriously
encroach upon the individual family. This will appear
<span class="pb" id="Pg120">[120]</span>
still more clearly when all these points are exhaustively
discussed in their bearing upon the individual family.</p>

<p>Now I would like to show that Howitt, as well as
Spencer and Gillen, based his assertions as to the group
marriage character of the <i>Pirrauru</i> relation upon a misleading
exaggeration of the importance of the sexual side
of marriage. Spencer and Gillen say that every man has
one or two individual wives or <i>Nupa</i> "allotted to him
as wives, and to whom he has the first but not the exclusive
right of access."<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 109.">[338]</a> But besides these there is the
<i>Pirrauru</i> institution in which "a group of women actually
have marital relations with a group of men." And
as a conclusion, it follows simply, that in Australia
there exists a group marriage, and that not a "pretended"
one (Spencer and Gillen criticize here Dr.
Westermarck's expression), but a "real" one. This
reasoning would inspire some mistrust by its summary
and laconic character alone.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor" title="Mr. Thomas has also remarked (loc. cit., p. 128) that Spencer and Gillen, who speak on page 109 of the real and not pretended group marriage among the Urabunna, say on the next page, that in the same tribe group marriage preceded the present state of things--and so contradict themselves. Such a carelessness is remarkable in a work, which in all other respects is a masterpiece; ...">[339]</a> But it is also evident that
in the passage quoted the authors speak exclusively of
the sexual side of marriage, and that they actually mean
to imply that this sexual side is everything which requires
attention, if marriage in a given case should be described.
And this is obviously false. The incorrect reasoning is
repeated by the same authors in their later work.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 140.">[340]</a> From
the fact that sexual access is open to the <i>Pirraurus</i>, and
that there are no special names for the individual parents
and children (which does not seem to hold good for the
Dieri, however), the inference is drawn that group marriage
exists instead of individual marriage. Not even the
<span class="pb" id="Pg121">[121]</span>
conditions under which a man has access to his <i>Pirrauru</i>
are discussed! Our discussion (from Howitt's detailed
data) has shown that even in sexual matters the <i>Pirrauru</i>
are far behind the Tippa Malku; indeed, that there is no
comparison between the sexual rights of an individual
husband and of a <i>Pirrauru</i>.</p>

<p>The same insufficiency of reasoning is shown by Howitt.
He says in one place<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor" title="Trans. R.S.V., p. 115.">[341]</a> that there is individual as well
as group marriage among the Australian aborigines.
But under the word marriage he understands the right
of sexual access. And on this ground he asserts that
among the Kurnai there existed individual marriages
exclusively; and among the Dieri there was also group
marriage. It is characteristic that no one of these
writers tried to give any explicit definition of marriage;
but from what I have quoted it appears quite clearly how
one-sidedly and narrowly they conceived marriage.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor" title="In order to appreciate my argument, the reader is requested to peruse the passages referred to from the works of Howitt, and from Spencer and Gillen, and judge from their full text whether I am not right. The full quotations of these passages would have encumbered the present work. As polemics are always rather barren, I preferred to abstain from them.">[342]</a>
And this conception was not only fatal to the theories
and views held by them on the question, but it vitiated
to a certain extent also the information they gave us
about these facts. For they did not try to ascertain and
to inform us about the most important particulars, which
were perhaps not quite out of the reach of their investigation.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor" title="This is an instance of the general truth that descriptive ethnography is highly dependent on the theories known and accepted by the investigator, and that information may be useful or useless according to whether the theoretical principles are correct or not. It is impossible for an observer to go below the surface if he does not discuss the phenomena and theorize on them. ...">[343]</a></p>

<p>We have based our discussion of the <i>Pirrauru</i> relation
<span class="pb" id="Pg122">[122]</span>
on a broad conception of marriage, determined by factors
of the daily life, the household, the relation to children,
etc. In our systematic and objective description of
facts relating to the <i>Pirrauru</i> relation we found in the first
place that individual marriage exists besides the custom
in question; that it has its radically distinctive features&mdash;a
different form of betrothal or allotment of a wife
to a man; an entirely different kind of sexual rights and
privileges; and, what is perhaps the most important fact,
an absolutely different aspect of the child question,
connected with the fact that only a man and his wife
form a real household, live in the same wurley, and share
their food supply together and in common with their
children. All these points constitute a real and radical
difference between the individual marriage connected with
the individual family, and the purely sexual connections
involved in the <i>Pirrauru</i> relation in its usual form, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i>
when the husband is present in camp. It is only during
the latter's absence or during diplomatic missions that
the <i>Pirrauru</i> relation assumes at all the character of
marriage: then both <i>Pirraurus</i> occupy the same camp,
the woman provides food for her <i>Pirrauru</i>, etc. But these
occasions are only temporary and exceptional ones, and
we are, unfortunately, not informed, even with the smallest
degree of approximation, how often they may on the
average occur, whether they are very rarely realized
exceptions, or whether they are facts that take place
fairly often. At any rate, it is certain that these essential
features of the <i>Pirrauru</i> relationship never take place
simultaneously with the individual marriage. In other
words, the individual marital relations are in force when
the real husband is in camp and all rights (even the
sexual ones) of the <i>Pirraurus</i> cease. So that although
the <i>Pirrauru</i> relation, on exceptional and probably rarely
recurring occasions, assumes a few more of the characteristics
of marriage, it never becomes anything like
actual marriage. And this is to be noted, too: the full
actuality of <i>Pirrauru</i> relations may come into force only
<span class="pb" id="Pg123">[123]</span>
under the condition that the husband be absent. It
is only by an incorrect and superficial exaggeration of
the sexual side of marriage, that the custom in question
has been baptized group marriage.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor" title="Unless we give to the word marriage a new meaning, which would be hardly useful.">[344]</a> And still less acceptable
is the assertion that this "group marriage" is "the
only form of marriage in existence" among the South
Central tribes.</p>

<p>We may remark about the sexual features of social life
in Australia in general, that far from bearing any character
of indiscriminate promiscuity on the whole, they are,
on the contrary, subject to strict regulations, restrictions,
and rules. Every form of licence must be subject to
customary rules. The principle of class exogamy is
maintained in the majority of cases: so the <i>Pirrauru</i>
relation is subject to class rule, as is also wife-lending,
wife-exchange, and the rare cases of licence among unmarried
girls and widows. But the licence occurring
during religious, totemic, and other ceremonies is, as we
have seen above, not subject to the class rule. Even the
most prohibited and tabooed degree&mdash;that between a
man and his mother-in-law&mdash;is violated by custom.</p>

<p>This fact is also noteworthy for the criticism of theories
which see both in class exogamy and in sexual licence
survivals of former group marriage. At some ceremonies
of a magical and religious character sexual licence occurs,
in agreement with the principle that survivals are always
connected with religious facts. But if class exogamy
is also a survival of group marriage, why should <em>this</em> fall
in abeyance on such occasions? For if these two principles
were so deeply connected, why should one of them (class
exogamy) be entirely neglected on the very occasion when
the other (ceremonial licence) is most conspicuous? Is
that not again one of the serious difficulties in the way of
the hypothesis of a previous group marriage, a difficulty
which at least must be accounted for, and which is always
completely ignored by the authors concerned?</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg124">[124]</span>
There is justification for saying that the notion of
adultery and the reprobation thereof is well known to
the aborigines, and that they punish and condemn unlawful
unions of all kinds. As W. E. Roth says, "morality in
a broad sense" is well known to the Australian aborigines.
It could be even said that sexual morality does exist,
only according to a special code, which is obviously
different from ours, if we understand by "morality" the
fact that there exists a series of determined norms and
that these norms are followed.</p>

<p>Closely connected with this question is the more psychological
problem of sexual jealousy. The existence of
sexual jealousy, especially on the part of the males, has
been often referred to by various authors in order to
criticize the theories of primitive promiscuity and group
marriage. On the other hand, it was pointed out that
motives of jealousy are much less strong among some
primitive peoples; and many instances have been
adduced to prove this assumption. So <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> about the
Australians, Spencer and Gillen say: "Amongst the
Australian natives with whom we have come in contact,
the feeling of sexual jealousy is not developed to anything
like the extent to which it would appear to be in many
other savage tribes." ... "It is indeed a factor which
need not be taken into serious account in regard to
the question of sexual relations amongst the Central
Australian tribes."<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., pp. 99, 100.">[345]</a></p>

<p>It seems to be beyond any doubt that sexual jealousy,
as <em>we</em> conceive it, is completely absent from the aboriginal
mind. It has always been a serious defect in ethnological
reasoning that such ideas and feelings as those
connected with our meaning of "jealousy" have usually
not been analyzed, nor the question asked whether they
had any meaning and place in a given society, or whether
we must assume other corresponding elements to give
a new content to the word. Our sexual jealousy&mdash;the
ideas as well as the feelings involved therein&mdash;is
<span class="pb" id="Pg125">[125]</span>
moulded by innumerable social factors; it is connected
with the notion of honour; it is the result of ideals of
pure love, individual sexual rights, sacredness of monogamy,
etc. One of the strongest motives is the care
for the certainty of physiological fatherhood: paternal
affection is strongly enhanced by the idea of blood connection
between a man and his offspring. All these
factors are obviously either absent or deeply modified in
the Australian aboriginal society. It is, therefore, quite
wrong to use the word jealousy and ask if it is present
among them, without trying to give to it its proper
content.</p>

<p>In the first place, we may assume in this society, as
in the whole of mankind and in the majority of higher
animals, a physiological basis for jealousy in the form of
an innate instinct;<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor" title="This expression is perhaps inexact. But this is not the place for psychological and biological analyses. The reader may be referred to Dr. Westermarck's conclusion that there is a strong instinct of sexual jealousy among primitive races of men, both in males (H.H.M., pp. 117-132) and in females (ibid., pp. 495-500). This instinct is inherited from our animal ancestors (compare Darwin, Descent of Man, ii. p. 395). ...">[346]</a> a natural aversion of an individual
towards an encroachment on his sexual rights and a
natural tendency to expand these rights as far as possible&mdash;within
certain variable limits. That among the
Australian aborigines such instincts of jealousy are not
absent, that they are, on the contrary, very strongly
developed, is evident from nearly all the facts quoted
and all general considerations. It is proved by the high
esteem in which in some tribes chastity is held; by the
fact that fidelity is required in all other tribes, and that
it yields only to custom. The demand for fidelity in all
tribes has been discussed above. There is a whole series
of statements that emphatically affirm a very strong
feeling of jealousy; and connected with it is the fact that
the majority of fights and quarrels are about women (Curr,
<span class="pb" id="Pg126">[126]</span>
Dawson, Mrs. Parker, Schürmann, Wilhelmi, Wilkes,
Turnbull, Phillipps, Tench, Spencer and Gillen). Now,
that these instincts of jealousy do not assume the delicate
and refined form they possess in our society, results
merely from the difference in the corresponding collective
ideas which influence and mould the elementary instinct.</p>

<p>With our few data available we can attempt only a
sketch of the psychology of the feelings of jealousy among
the aborigines. It may be observed that although the
sentiment of sexual love might be postulated in all human
hearts, it seems to be, to a certain extent, banished from
the majority of the Australian matrimonial matches by
the very way in which they were brought about.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor" title="Compare above, p. 83.">[347]</a></p>

<p>This must also to a great extent deprive jealousy of its
violent character. On the other hand, social opinion,
which in our society works through ideas of honour and
ridicule, strengthening the feelings of jealousy and giving
to them a certain outer prestige, even in cases when they
may not be actually felt&mdash;in the Australian Aboriginal
Society uses these factors with a directly contrary effect.
As a matter of fact, in many cases, public opinion compels
a man to give his wife away; it is considered an incident
of hospitality, a virtue. In other cases it is an honourable
duty, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> in cases of wife offering during a ceremony in
order to express gratitude. We read that in cases where
a man begrudges his wife to a <i>Pirrauru</i> he is regarded
as churlish. Obviously, these social factors act here to
modify and moderate the feeling of sexual jealousy. We
find no instance or statement which would point to a
contrary influence of these factors in the Australian
aboriginal society.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor" title="Custom referring to a certain point--here e. g. to the question whether it is honourable or ignominious to waive one's marital rights--stands in the relation of correspondence to the collective ideas and collective feelings on this point. The expression of Spencer and Gillen that the feeling of jealousy is 'subservient to that of the influence of tribal custom' is therefore incorrect (Nat. Tr., p. 99). ...">[348]</a> But, as pointed out above, the idea
<span class="pb" id="Pg127">[127]</span>
of individual sexual over-right and control over his wife
is strongly present in the aboriginal mind. This right is
undoubtedly realized as a privilege, and the natural
tendency to keep his privileges for himself, or dispose
of them according to his wish or interest, must create
a strong opposition to any encroachment. In other
words, the sexual act has its intrinsic value, and it is
considered as an unquestionable advantage. And the
right to this advantage constitutes a kind of private
property. The feeling of jealousy exists here in its
economic sense: the proprietor of a certain object
begrudges the use of it to any one whom he does not invite
to it, or who is not otherwise entitled to the privilege.
And this seems to me one of the strongest probable
sources of jealousy, besides the natural physiological
impulse of aversion, mentioned above. I think it is
corroborated by the facts enumerated, which show that
the husband vigilantly watches over and keeps his
over-right.</p>

<p>In regard to the motive of jealousy as connected with
<span class="pb" id="Pg128">[128]</span>
the question of progeny&mdash;the care to be sure of a man's
own real paternity of his children, we may remark that
this motive must be absent in many tribes, viz. in those
tribes where the physiological rôle of the father in procreation
is not known. We know with all certainty that
this is the case in the Central and North Central tribes, as
well as in the North-east part of the continent.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor" title="See below, pp. 209 sqq. and 226.">[349]</a> But it
appears to be the case in the South Central tribes. It is
stated that the Urabunna have quite analogous beliefs in
reincarnation of ancestors, in their dwelling-places, and
other totemic matters.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nor. Tr., pp. 146 sqq.">[350]</a> Spencer and Gillen do not say anything
definite about the appreciation or want of knowledge
of physiological paternity, but that is perhaps because
they were less well acquainted with the Urabunna, who
were also probably in a more advanced stage of decay.
By analogy it may be inferred that the Urabunna, like all
the other neighbouring tribes, had with the whole apparatus
of analogous beliefs, also the lack of the knowledge
in question. We might infer the same about the Dieri
and kindred tribes, who seem to be almost identical in
all respects with the Urabunna, but of whose religious
and totemic ideas we are by no means so well informed
as of their social organization; in fact, for these
psychological data it is undoubtedly to Spencer and
Gillen that we owe the major part of our knowledge
about Australia.</p>

<p>Certainly the ignorance of physiological fatherhood
in the South Central tribes is of a hypothetical
character. But provided it is a fact, we see that the area
occupied by tribes which believe in the supernatural
begetting of children extends over the whole Central and
North-east area. There is no evidence on this point in
the case of the Western tribes. We find only in the
South-eastern tribes a knowledge of the real process
of procreation. It is interesting to note that thus the
area of greater sexual promiscuity and less pronounced
<span class="pb" id="Pg129">[129]</span>
jealousy is conterminous with the area where natural
paternity is unknown. Whether there be any real
dependence between these two series of facts it is impossible
to assert, as our knowledge of the natives'
psychology is too scanty. But if our information on this
point be reliable, and if these limits be correct, then the
coincidence just noted is rather suggestive.</p>

<p>To return to the question of jealousy, we have, after
having stated the general problems, discussed the influence
exercised on it by social pressure or custom and
other psychical factors. Finally we have shown that the
sexual act is not in all tribes conceived as leading to childbirth,
and that this bears upon the problem of jealousy.
But it must be remembered that they have ideas of the
sexual act which are entirely foreign to us, and which may
account also for some differences in their views of, and
feelings about, jealousy. Here come in ideas of the magic
influences and virtues attributed to the sexual act. In
Australia there are unmistakable signs of it.</p>

<p>The ceremonial act of defloration, in connection with the
initiation of females, is undoubtedly connected with some
mystic ideas of its magical character. This is shown
especially clearly in the fact that this ceremonial act is
employed for medicinal or hygienic purposes, as stated in
Roth and in Beveridge.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor" title="Roth, Ethnol. Stud., p. 174. Beveridge, p. 53, Latin note.">[351]</a> We saw that the only instance
of the exchange of wives in the Kurnai tribe was when it
was ordered by the old men, to avert impending evil. The
same is reported by Cameron of some of the Darling River
tribes. This shows clearly how feelings of jealousy,
which seem to have been fairly strong in this tribe, may
be subservient to a belief in the magical, beneficial
influence of sexual intercourse, performed in a certain
prescribed way. The many instances in which sexual
intercourse, usually not between husband and wife,
takes place during certain religious ceremonies, as well
as the fact of sexual abstinence, which is often to be
observed on such occasions, shows that it has its magical
<span class="pb" id="Pg130">[130]</span>
side. From this conception of the sexual act as endowed
with some magic properties, there would result differences
in the ideas and feelings connected with jealousy. On the
one hand, such magic properties would require in some
cases the waiving of individual sexual rights, as we saw
in some of the instances just mentioned. And in these
cases the instincts of jealousy would be suppressed by the
more powerful feelings inspired by supernatural apprehensions.
On the other hand, it is possible&mdash;although
there are no examples of it&mdash;that the very magical aspect
of the sexual act would make it especially subject to
jealous watchfulness and exclusiveness. Apart from
any speculations, it appears certain that all these different
ideas and conceptions are in intimate interdependence,
and that we can only safely speak about jealousy (or any
other such compounded psychical complex) in a given
society, when we know all such connections.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor" title="The idea of a radical difference in the psychological aspect of jealousy among lower races of men is set forth by Dr. Westermarck: 'Jealousy ... is far from being the same feeling in the mind of a savage as in that of a civilized man.'--H.H.M., p. 30.">[352]</a></p>

<p>To sum up our results in this survey of jealousy in the
Australian aboriginal society. <em>Negatively</em>: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A priori</i> it
may be said that nothing like sexual jealousy in our sense
of this word&mdash;save the broad and uncertain physiological
instinct&mdash;can exist. As a matter of fact, a whole series
of customs, duties, and tribal regulations absolutely contradict
the existence of jealousy in our sense. <em>Positively</em>:
The existence of strong instincts of jealousy in many cases
must be acknowledged. To understand the more definite
forms which these instincts assume, it is necessary to
note the presence or absence of motives which would
influence, check, or develop these instincts. The unquestionable
physiological instinct of jealousy and the
natural tendency to keep up one's private exclusive rights,
are two sources from which jealousy seems to be derived.
It is deeply influenced by the ideas on the magical character
of the sexual act which the Australian aborigines
<span class="pb" id="Pg131">[131]</span>
undoubtedly possess; and in the majority of tribes by
the absence of the knowledge of physical paternity.
The tribal customs show that it does not amount to the
idea of exclusive inviolable personal rights which essentially
characterize our conception and feelings of jealousy.
But within its narrower limits it seems to be very strong
and important.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><span class="pb" id="Pg132">[132]</span>
<small>MODE OF LIVING</small></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The three points hitherto discussed refer more exclusively
to the relationship between husband and wife,
and do not involve that between parents and children.
They bear more on marriage than on the family. But, as
so often repeated, the full description of marriage can be
made only in connection with, and on the basis of, a
knowledge of the family life in its larger sense. We proceed
now to this more general discussion, and in order to
carry it out on broad foundations it will be well in the
first place to consider the family unit<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor" title="Under the term 'family unit' I understand in this study only the group constituted by husband, wife and their children.">[353]</a> in connection with
the territorial and tribal organization; that is to consider
the mode of living of the family in connection
with the higher territorial and tribal units. It has been
repeatedly said that each social unit should be discussed
in connection with the general structure of society and the
general conditions of life in a given area. When theoretically
stated this appears a commonplace; in practice
it is seldom carried out by ethnologists.</p>

<p>That the facts of aggregation are of the highest importance
in sociology appears also to be quite clear.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor" title="'In the study of population ... the facts of aggregation or grouping are the first to claim our attention.' (F. H. Giddings, Princ. of Sociology, p.79). In fact all the social phenomena of higher order corresponding to differentiation and constitution depend upon the facts of grouping. In the lowest societies, as the Australian, the mode of living in very small groups precludes a priori the possibility of any higher social formations. ...">[354]</a> These
<span class="pb" id="Pg133">[133]</span>
facts have been described by Mr. Wheeler for the Australian
aboriginal society, and we shall in several places refer
to his work. It will serve us as a basis in the following
discussion, which nevertheless does not appear superfluous
as it is connected more exclusively with the problem
of family. In this connection the main question to be
asked is: Do the natives usually live scattered, in single
families, or in larger groups? All the features of family
life&mdash;the husband's authority, the sexual marital relation,
the economics of the household, the relation of children
to parents&mdash;would appear in a different light, and our
ideas thereon might in many respects be modified according
to the answer we obtained to the above question.
This point (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> the mode of living) would also be decisive
in the problem of group relationship: if the natives live
normally in single families, which assemble only occasionally,
then the individuality of the family relationship is
placed beyond any doubt. And if there are, besides, any
group relations, they must radically and absolutely differ
from the individual one; for the latter, and it only, is
constituted by the most powerfully binding element&mdash;continuous
daily contact. If, however, the aborigines
live in more or less numerous groups, our question is still
open, and we have to inquire: Do the families, which
(permanently or temporarily) form one body, live in a
state of social communism and promiscuity? Or are
<span class="pb" id="Pg134">[134]</span>
they more or less isolated from each other? That will
form the second part of our task.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor" title="The importance of the aboriginal mode of living in the study of family life and kinship bonds has been well brought out by Dr. Westermarck (H.H.M., pp. 42 sqq., especially pp. 43-47). His general inference--that in low societies the scattered mode of living brings into prominence individual kinship bonds, and isolates the family unit--will be corroborated by our conclusions drawn from the Australian material. ...">[355]</a></p>

<p>Let us now gather information about the first point,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> the size of the groups in which the natives live. Our
statements are at first sight contradictory on this point;
but this is largely due to the total lack of fixed terminology.
It will be well to settle the latter beforehand and
determine more exactly what we are to look for in the
statements. For that purpose we must forestall the
results of our research and broadly outline the state of
things; it will give us a guiding thread through the
statements. Roughly speaking, in Australia the tribe
as a social unit is characterized by name, common speech,
custom and territory.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor" title="See Wheeler, loc. cit., pp. 15 sqq., and the references given there.">[356]</a> It is divided (and sometimes
subdivided again) into smaller groups; these consist of
individuals closely related, possess a sort of government,
and are connected with a portion of the tribal territory
which they practically use in common.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 45, 46.">[357]</a> For the social
division of the tribes is connected with and complicated
by a parallel territorial partition. And there is always a
certain territory allotted to the exclusive possession of a

considered as proprietor<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor" title="To guard against misunderstanding I wish to emphasize that such words and expressions as 'proprietor,' 'ownership,' 'landed property,' 'rights to a tract of country,' etc., are not to be taken in the sense which they possess in application to higher societies, to our own society in particular. Their correct meaning will be gathered from the following discussion. ...">[358]</a> of the territory, for its different
<span class="pb" id="Pg135">[135]</span>
divisions may not encroach upon each other's grounds.
We shall call (by way of definition) a <em>Local Group</em>, such a
division of the tribe as possesses the exclusive right to
use a given territory and to dwell within its limits. In
the following statements we will give a series of examples
of these local units, and the different forms they assume
in different tribes. It will be possible, too, to give a more
precise meaning to the word "proprietorship"; and to
see in what sense land may be possessed or claimed by
the Australian blacks. The authors seldom try to give
to these terms any clear meaning, or to discern all the
existing differences; but these will be evident enough
from the facts contained in the statements. The problem
of territorial division is only the basis for our main
question, viz. the mode of living. The Local Group,
which is the joint owner of its territory, is, so to say, only
the upper limit of aggregation; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> the body of persons
actually and normally living together cannot be larger
than that group, for only its members are (in normal
conditions) admitted to its grounds. But this Local
Group may also live scattered over its district. There
will be several data in our information which would
rather confirm us in this supposition.</p>

<p>Now let us review the statements, bearing in mind the
exact meaning given to the words Tribe, Local Group
and Family. We have agreed to call Local Group a unit
owning in common a portion of country, and we are asking
how big this unit is in different tribes; if it lives scattered
or in a body; finally, what idea can we form of "land
ownership" in Australia.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg136">[136]</span>
<i>Statements.</i>&mdash;The Kurnai were divided into five exogamous
"clans."<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor" title="According to Howitt's terminology.">[359]</a> These were divided and subdivided several times,
"each subdivision having its own tract of hunting and food
ground, until the unit was a small group of kindred, frequently
an old man, his sons, married or unmarried, with their respective
wives and children." The author gives an instance of a
family claiming a certain island and the swans' eggs laid on it,
as its property,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., pp. 73, 74.">[360]</a> and living under the authority of the oldest
male in the family. "Taking such a family<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor" title="We would say local group, as we reserve the term family for an undivided group living in the closest unity, and consisting of a man, his wife and his children.">[361]</a> as the tribal
unit of the Kurnai, it was the aggregation of such families
that formed what may be called a division, inhabiting a large
area, and the aggregate of the divisions formed the clan."<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 74.">[362]</a>
This, and the expression family as "tribal unit," shows that
probably its members lived actually together. It is a pity
that Howitt does not give even approximately the numbers.
Again, in another place, he writes of a "natural spread of
families over a tract of country," and of "elders as heads of
families."<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor" title="Idem, Kam. and Kurn., p. 215.">[363]</a> These "families" unite in cases of mutual need
for aid and protection<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[364]</a> and in cases of corroborees,
initiations, etc.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor" title="Compare chapter on initiations in Howitt's Nat. Tr., and Kam. and Kurn., passim.">[365]</a>&mdash;Here the local group was a small unit of
related persons. It claimed a certain territory and exclusively
used its products, and vested authority in its oldest male.
These local groups usually must have lived isolated from each
other, because of the exclusive right in using the given area.
Howitt mentions also the beginnings of individual claims to
some products (swan's eggs) being even transmitted by inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., p. 232 footnote.">[366]</a></p>

<p>The statements of Howitt concerning the Murring tribes
are not quite clear. "Claims to a particular tract of country
arose in certain of these tribes by birth."<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 82.">[367]</a> He does not say
if these claims consisted in actual right to live, roam and hunt
over the said tract of country. It is probable, however, that
just this is the meaning, as he speaks immediately afterwards
of an hereditary principle as to the grounds determining the
habitation where one lives&mdash;a father pointing out the bounds
of his child's country&mdash;"where his father lived, or himself was
<span class="pb" id="Pg137">[137]</span>
born and had lived."<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 83.">[368]</a> If we can assume that each "family"
(= local group) had its hunting-grounds so designated this
would point to a far-going subdivision of country and consequently
of the tribe; we can hardly infer anything conclusive
from this statement alone. But it appears clearer in the
light of the following remark: "The local group has in all
cases been perpetuated in the same place from father to son
by occupation, I may almost say by inheritance, of the
hunting-grounds."<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Smith. Rep. 83, p. 816.">[369]</a> It seems, therefore, that generally in
the tribes studied by Howitt, the local group (he calls it
the "family," speaking of the Kurnai) was a very well-defined
unit. And that, in the tribes in question the people who
inherit a certain territory from father to son are just members
of the local group. Its rights to the hunting-grounds were
based on some&mdash;perhaps magic or religious&mdash;ideas of heredity.</p>

<p>An analogous state of things is reported to have obtained
among the Wurunjerri (Victoria): "The right to hunt and
to procure food in any particular tract of the country belonged
to the group of people born there, and could not be infringed
by others without permission."<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 311.">[370]</a> In the territory of the same
tribe there was a stone-quarry, the material of which was very
valuable to the natives. The quarry was the property of a
group of people living on the spot; the head of this group had
special rights in connection with it. "It was Billi-billeri,
the head of the family, whose country included the quarry,
who lived on it, and took care of it for the whole of the
Wurunjerri community."<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[371]</a> This statement appears to me
very important, as it shows how rights of possession might
belong to a local group and centre in the headman of this
group. This statement suffices to reconcile the apparent
contradiction between individual claims to a country and
group claims.</p>

<p>The local groups amongst the Bangerang, who lived at the
junction of the Murray and Goulburn Rivers, seem to have been
more numerous, owing, perhaps, to the easiness of food supply
on the banks of two fishy rivers.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, Recollections, pp. 231, 240.">[372]</a> The tribe was divided in
two exogamous moieties,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor" title="Local exogamous moieties, not phratries!">[373]</a> and the land "was parcelled out
between these two sub-tribes."<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, Recollections, p. 243.">[374]</a> Each respectively lived in
a body, although moving sometimes from place to place.
Curr speaks of their head-quarters in places abounding with
fish.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 231.">[375]</a> One of the sections numbered about 150, the other somewhat
<span class="pb" id="Pg138">[138]</span>
less. These two "sub-tribes" or moieties constituted,
therefore, rather numerous local groups. The "sub-tribes"
of the kindred tribes mentioned by Curr seem also to have been
numerous,<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 234.">[376]</a> and to have lived each in a body,<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor" title="It is never said clearly; but compare the story told in XIII, of the meeting of two tribes, and passim through the work, p. 174 and others.">[377]</a> so that they
would be, according to our terminology, numerous local
groups. Curr speaks also of individual property in land, but
this seems to have had only a purely fictitious meaning,
having nothing to do with any real right.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 243, 244.">[378]</a> Private property
in other things (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> fishing weirs, etc.) was known.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 243.">[379]</a></p>

<p>Curr uses the term <em>tribe</em> in place of our <em>local group</em>. In his
general work on Australia he gives a definition of tribe which
quite agrees with what we called local group.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor" title="It is used here in agreement with G. C. Wheeler, Spencer and Gillen, Howitt, etc.">[380]</a> "By the
word tribe I mean a number of men closely allied by blood, and
living in the strictest alliance, offensive and defensive, who,
with their wives and children, occupy, practically in common,
and in exclusion of others, a tract of country...." Everybody
must respect the customs of his tribe; and as no one may
live apart from the tribal community, "there is no alternative
between compliance with tribal custom and death."<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, A.R., i. pp. 61, 62.">[381]</a>
"Although the lands of a tribe are <em>nominally</em> parcelled
out amongst its members, it is the fact that they are used in
common, and for several reasons must have always been used
so." First, because for mutual protection the tribesmen
must have often associated. Secondly, because of the
economic conditions the tribe often was compelled to feed
on a given spot.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 64, 65.">[382]</a></p>

<p>Angas, describing his travels in the Murray River district,
tells that he met several times with native encampments; from
the passage in question<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. p. 74.">[383]</a> we may infer that they were small
groups. He says<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. p. 81.">[384]</a> that on the seaside (Encounter Bay), on
the lakes, and on the Murray banks, where means of subsistence
were fairly easy, the local groups were numerous. But this
information is very loose.</p>

<p>Amongst the tribes of the Lower Murray River "particular
districts having a radius of from ten to twenty miles, or in
other cases varying according to local circumstances, are
considered generally as being the property and hunting-grounds
<span class="pb" id="Pg139">[139]</span>
of the tribes who frequent them."<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor" title="Eyre, ii. p. 297.">[385]</a> Eyre speaks of a further
division of land amongst single individuals; it is handed down
hereditarily in the male line. "A man can dispose of or barter
his land to others."<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 218, 297.">[386]</a> At any rate, all members of a "tribe"
(= local group) may roam over the common territory. It
seems, nevertheless, to be rather a formal than actual, exclusive
right.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 297.">[387]</a> The local groups may not trespass on their respective
territories without permission.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., ii. p. 297.">[388]</a> The whole local group
congregates only "if there is any particular variety more
abundant than another, or procurable only in certain localities.
Should this not be the case, then they are probably scattered
over their district in detached groups, or separate families."<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 218.">[389]</a>
Here we are well informed on our principal points: the local
group is the exclusive joint landowner; the individual has
some claims which are not quite clearly defined, but surely
do not mean exclusive economic <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usum fructum</i>. They live
scattered in small parties over their area. There is another
passage in Eyre's book that confirms this latter point. He
says that each family is independent and governed by the
father; but that, "as a matter of policy, he always informs
his fellows where he is going." So that "although a tribe
may be dispersed all over their own district in single groups ...
yet if you meet with any one family, they can at once tell you
where you will find any other.... In cases of sudden
danger or emergency, the scattered groups are rapidly
warned or collected" by messenger or smoke signals.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., ii. p. 317.">[390]</a></p>

<p>Mitchell's expedition, when exploring the interior of South-East
Australia, met a party of blacks on the banks of the
Murray, whom they had seen before on the Darling a few
hundred miles distant.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor" title="Mitchell, loc. cit., ii. p. 92.">[391]</a> This would apparently contradict
the assumption of fixed boundaries. But the general evidence
shows that, in exceptional cases, and with the leave of the
neighbouring tribes&mdash;especially if these were friendly&mdash;a local
group or any party of natives were allowed to travel even
considerable distances for purposes of warfare, barter or
ceremonial gatherings.</p>

<p>Amongst the Aborigines of Encounter Bay and Lower
Murray River (the Narrinyeri) the local groups (H. E. A.
Meyer calls them "tribes,"<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor" title="H. E. A. Meyer, loc. cit., p. 198.">[392]</a> or "large families" of connected
people) seem to be numerous (the country abounds with fish
and birds). These local groups have their head-quarters,
from which their name is derived. But only in cases of great
<span class="pb" id="Pg140">[140]</span>
abundance of food does the local group live and move together.
Usually single families roam in parties; the sick and aged
remain in the head-quarters, and suffer often from want of food.
Not only in search of food, but for the sake of performing
corroborees, initiations, etc., and visiting each other, do these
local groups roam about the country.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor" title="H. E. A. Meyer, loc. cit., pp. 191, 192.">[393]</a></p>

<p>From a passage in Taplin<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor" title="Taplin, loc. cit., p. 35.">[394]</a> we may infer that the local
group of the Narrinyeri near Lake Alexandrina numbered
about 200 natives.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 36.">[395]</a> The local groups of this tribe were, besides,
exogamous, totemic, and had a regular form of government.
We have not even a hint as to their mode of living; but
if plentiful food supply was the chief condition of larger
aggregations, then these latter would naturally have developed
better in the lake country.</p>

<p>Among the natives of Yorke's Peninsula there are local
divisions; each with a certain totem and with headmen.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor" title="T. M. Sutton, loc. cit., p. 17.">[396]</a>
This seems analogous to the conditions among the Narrinyeri
and Central tribes; but the information is not detailed
enough to be considered quite reliable.</p>

<p>The Port Lincoln tribes seem to roam about in small parties
of several families.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor" title="Schürmann, loc. cit., p. 221.">[397]</a> This statement is not sufficiently clear;
probably a number of such parties constituted a local group.</p>

<p>We read, again, about the Port Lincoln tribes: "Each
family has its distinct place, where they live together."<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor" title="Chas. Wilhelmi, p. 178.">[398]</a> The
uncertainty as to the sense in which the word <em>family</em> is used
here makes this statement nearly useless. The same author
says in another place: "It has been remarked that the
population and general condition of the natives of Australia
greatly depend on the nature of the locality they occupy;
where the country is sterile and unproductive the natives
are found to congregate in small numbers. In fertile districts
they are comparatively numerous."<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 165.">[399]</a> This opinion is in
agreement with the fact that the population round Lake
Alexandrina, where food supply was plentiful, was extremely
dense.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor" title="Compare T. Gill, loc. cit., p. 223, on the authority of Dr. Moorhouse.">[400]</a></p>

<p>An author who has made his observations on the blacks
of the Murrumbidgee River (New South Wales) and Moreton
Bay (Queensland) writes: Each "tribe" (= local group)
occupies a definite tract of country; a trespass of its boundaries
by a stranger is punished with death.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor" title="G. S. Lang, loc. cit., p. 5.">[401]</a> This common
<span class="pb" id="Pg141">[141]</span>
district is subdivided among families of the local group.
"During seasons when all the members of the tribe are not
congregated together, each family hunts on its own grounds."
The author quotes, also, instances where trees were marked
and belonged to individuals.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor" title="G. S. Lang, loc. cit., p. 14.">[402]</a> This statement answers both
our questions as to land ownership and modes of living;
in both respects the "family" is the unit: it owns its
area and it lives on and uses it normally in isolation from
the others; proprietorship means here exclusive use. But
we must bear in mind that what is called here family may
as well be a small local group of closely related people, like
those among the Kurnai. At any rate it certainly means that
the blacks live in very small groups, perhaps in individual
families, and that this scattered mode of living rests on a
territorial basis. (In general the authority of G. S. Lang
cannot be said to be of the best.)</p>

<p>We read in the travels of Gerstaecker that natives carefully
keep to the boundaries of their own district. So that a
traveller, to be quite safe, should always change his guide
when entering upon a new territory.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor" title="Refers probably to the Murrumbidgee tribes. Op. cit., iii. p. 9.">[403]</a></p>

<p>We read about the tribes of New South Wales in general:
"Though they are constantly wandering about, yet they
usually confine themselves to a radius of fifty or sixty miles
from the place they consider their residence. If they venture
beyond this, which they sometimes do with a party of whites,
they always betray the greatest fear of falling in with some
Myall or stranger blacks, who they say would put them to
death immediately."<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor" title="Chas. Wilkes (larger edition), ii. p. 187.">[404]</a> We find here again the local group
owning its territory and having head-quarters; as well as the
sacrosanctity of boundaries.</p>

<p>Turnbull remarks about the New South Wales tribes that
the best food supply, and consequently the largest gatherings,
were possible on the sea-shore and on the banks of fishy
rivers.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 89.">[405]</a></p>

<p>An example of family proprietorship in land is mentioned
by Collins.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. p. 599.">[406]</a> From it, it appears that this sort of proprietorship
meant rather some mystic claim than any exclusive right
of economic character.</p>

<p>We are informed that among the natives of New South Wales
there is a great number of small tribes, each containing from
forty to fifty individuals. "Each tribe has a certain beat, or
hunting-ground, frequently of not more than twenty miles in
<span class="pb" id="Pg142">[142]</span>
diameter, from which they never move, unless on certain
occasions when they visit the territory of a neighbouring
tribe for the purpose of a fight, or a ceremony. Sometimes,
the tribe will wander about in parties of five or ten; at other
times all the members will encamp together."<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor" title="Henderson, loc. cit., p. 108.">[407]</a> In substituting
the word <em>local group</em> for <em>tribe</em>, we get here again a fairly good
statement.</p>

<p>In the statements of Fraser we find again the local group;
he calls it "sub-tribe." It derives its name from a certain
locality, owns a tract of country, which is guarded jealously
against any infringement from any of the neighbouring sub-tribes.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 36.">[408]</a>
This statement is illustrated by an example, and
therefore appears rather trustworthy.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 37.">[409]</a></p>

<p>"Each tribe is divided into independent families, which
acknowledge no chief, and which inhabit in common a district
within certain limits, generally not exceeding above ten or
twelve miles on any side." The tribes number from 100 to
300.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor" title="Port Stephens tribe. R. Dawson, pp. 326, 327.">[410]</a> "The families belonging to a tribe meet together upon
occasions of festivals at certain seasons, and also to consult
upon all important occasions."<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., compare also p. 63.">[411]</a> The first phrase is not
clear: we are not told whether what he calls the tribe owns
its area in common, or whether the divisions called "independent
families" possess each its own district. From the
context, however, we see that we must assume the latter.
Three hundred people occupy in Australia usually more than
a hundred square miles.</p>

<p>Hodgkinson, speaking of the tribes between Port Macquarie
and Moreton Bay, says that the tribes (local groups) keep each
within very narrow limits. The district of each of them
measures about 150 square miles; usually some ten to twelve
miles of a river bank and the adjoining hinterland. "The
whole body of a tribe is never united on the same spot, unless
on some important occasion. They are more generally
divided into small parties of eight or ten men, with their
women and children, for the greater convenience of hunting,
etc., and these detached companies roam over any part of the
country within the prescribed limits of the main tribe to which
they belong."<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor" title="Hodgkinson, loc. cit., p. 222.">[412]</a> This statement agrees with the general type
of information.</p>

<p>Of the Coombangree tribe, New South Wales, it is said:
"Each tribe kept its own belt of country and separated into
<span class="pb" id="Pg143">[143]</span>
small camps, and only collected on special occasions."<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor" title="Science of Man, 1900, p. 116, article by A. C. McDougall.">[413]</a> In
this statement the words "local group" should be substituted
for "tribe."</p>

<p>The Dieri, divided into five local hordes, are still subdivided
into smaller "local groups, each having a definite tract of
hunting and food ground."<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 46.">[414]</a> These local groups cannot
be very numerous. The whole tribe numbers about 250.
There are at least ten local groups, since they include about
twenty persons each. But we do not know whether such a
local group lived in a body or scattered over its territory.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor" title="Gason, loc. cit., p. 258.">[415]</a></p>

<p>We owe one of our best statements as to the nature
of the local group to Spencer and Gillen. Its totemic
character, its organization with the <i>alatunja</i> at its head,
the different functions of magico-religious character and
many other social functions and characteristics define it
perfectly well.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., pp. 9, 16 and passim throughout both works, especially in connection with the description of totemism and totemic cult.">[416]</a> The territorial division seems to be much
the same in all the tribes studied by Messrs. Spencer and
Gillen. "In all the tribes there is a division into local groups,
which occupy certain well-defined areas within the tribal
territory."<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 27.">[417]</a> The possession of land is vested in them.
"There is no such thing as one man being regarded as the
owner of any tract of country. In every case the unit of
division is the local totemic group."<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[418]</a> This statement is
quite clear. The local group owns a certain area, and all the
individuals have the right to hunt and roam over it. They
do not do it in one body, they live scattered in much smaller
parties of one or two families. "The members of this (local
group) wander, perhaps in small parties of one or two families,
often, for example, two or more brothers with their wives and
children, over the land which they own, camping at favourite
spots, where the presence of water-holes, with their accompaniment
of vegetable and animal food, enables them to
supply their wants."<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 16.">[419]</a> Here the picture is perfectly clear:
the territorial unit is the local group; within its grounds
all members have the right to hunt and roam; no other
people may trespass over the boundaries. Such trespasses
do not in reality frequently happen.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 31.">[420]</a> The area is not only
economically the property of the local group, there are much
stronger ties between the land, once the hunting and ceremonial
ground of the Alcheringa ancestors, and their actual
<span class="pb" id="Pg144">[144]</span>
descendants.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor" title="The ties between a totemic local group and its hunting-grounds are based on the whole cycle of totemic ideas on reincarnation, supernatural conception; on the Oknanikilla and Ertnatulunga. The reader must be referred to the works of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen and Strehlow and to what is said about these points below in connection with the native ideas on conception (Chap. VI.).">[421]</a> But the local group does not form one body;
division into single families seems to be, under ordinary
circumstances, the normal status. We get here a good
insight into the inner structure of a local group, the chief
feature of which is the isolation of families. The local group
acts as a body chiefly on ceremonial occasions. To sum up:
the local group is the joint land-owner; proprietorship means
exclusive rights to hunt and roam over the country; but in
the native's mind it has much deeper roots, and the connection
between the local group and its hunting-grounds is based upon
all their traditions and creeds. Their mode of living is
scattered; they hang usually round favourite spots (see below).</p>

<p>Speaking of the totemic myths of the Northern tribes Mr.
Mathews says: "In those olden days, as at present, the
totemic ancestors consisted of families or groups of families,
who had their recognized grounds in some part of the tribal
territory."<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor" title="J. and Pr. R.S.N.S.W., xl. p. 108.">[422]</a></p>

<p>Among the natives of Queensland<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor" title="Moreton Bay. J.D. Lang, p. 335, 336.">[423]</a> the territory is parcelled
out completely amongst the different local groups; the
boundaries are well known and mutually respected. This
district is again subdivided amongst the members of the local
group; the proprietor "has the exclusive right to direct when
it should be hunted over, and the grass burned and the wild
animals destroyed." If other men aggregate and use the
products of his land he is regarded as the master of ceremonies.
This statement gives us at least a clear and consistent definition
of private proprietorship, which seems to be of a formal,
ceremonial character. But it is not complete. We do not
know if normally each family enjoys its district alone, with
the head of the family always master of ceremonies, or whether
the whole local group, or parts of it, hunt and roam usually
in bodies. This statement is, therefore, not very useful.</p>

<p>We read about the Kabi and Wakka tribes of Queensland:
"A few families claiming the same territory usually camped
and travelled together, sometimes in smaller, sometimes in
larger numbers. I characterize such family groups as communities."<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor" title="J. Mathew, i. p. 128.">[424]</a>
And again: "Such communities were constituted
<span class="pb" id="Pg145">[145]</span>
by a few families occupying the same small area in
common."<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor" title="J. Mathew, i. p. 129.">[425]</a> This is a clear definition of what we called local
group, and agrees perfectly well with the general picture
already outlined.</p>

<p>E. Palmer says that the game and other products of a certain
country belonged to the tribe (= local group) there residing;
the boundaries were respected and trespassers punished by
death.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor" title="E. Palmer, J.A.I., xiii. pp. 278, 279.">[426]</a></p>

<p>In North-West Central Queensland the "tribe" (our local
group) has its head-quarters.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor" title="Roth, Eth. Stud., p. 133, § 226.">[427]</a> This group has also an over-right
over its territory, "over which the community as a
whole has the right to hunt and roam."<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor" title="Idem, Bull. viii. p. 8.">[428]</a> There is still a
further subdivision; each family possesses hunting-grounds
of its own, and no other has the right to any product thereof
without the family's permission. In the case of tribesmen,
transgression is a trifle; in that of strangers, a very serious
offence.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid. and Proc. R.S.Q., pp. 50, 51.">[429]</a> The statements of Roth do not, however, say
anything about their mode of living. The mention of "head-quarters"
points to a subdivision of land amongst families
and to a scattered mode of living. In all probability we
may assume here the following form: the local group as
joint owner of its land; and single families having special
rights to certain parts of it, and camping as a rule separately
or in small groups, and aggregating in cases of emergency at
the head-quarters. This is the only statement which attributes
to families and individuals respectively a virtually exclusive
right over a certain ground. We read in another place of
the mode or rather the principle according to which individual
proprietorship is determined in the North Queensland tribes:
"The child's own country, its 'home' where it will in the
future have the right to hunt and roam, is determined
not by the place of actual birth, but by the locality where his
<i>choi</i> had been held apart." <i>Choi</i> is the spirit part of the child's
father, embodied in the father's afterbirth. The place of this
<i>choi</i> is carefully determined after the child's birth, according
to a customary ceremonial.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor" title="Bull. v. pp. 18, 23.">[430]</a> The extent of a local group is
determined in the following statement: "there were from
twelve to twenty heads of families constituting the group,
each with its particular division, who together made the
tribe."<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor" title="Idem, Proc. R.S.Q., p. 69.">[431]</a> Here again the land seems to be allotted to the
local group, though, according to the foregoing passages, there
was a further subdivision according to families.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg146">[146]</span>
As an instance showing that there were sometimes territorial
changes and shifting of tribes may be quoted the statement
of G. W. Earl, who says that a big tribe came from the
interior and established itself at the base of Coburg Peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 241, 242.">[432]</a>
How far this statement is reliable it is difficult to say.
Anyhow it is in opposition to the numerous and reliable
statements which affirm that tribal boundaries were strictly
kept and never changed.</p>

<p>The natives of Melville Island seem to have lived in more
numerous groups. Major Campbell says that their "tribes"
number from thirty to fifty persons each. On visiting an
encampment he found about thirty wigwams, which would
point to about fifty persons at least. "They lead a wandering
life, though I think each tribe confines itself to a limited
district."<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 156, 157.">[433]</a></p>

<p>A clear statement concerning the scattered mode of life is
given of the North-Western aborigines by J. G. Withnell,
who lived amongst them for twenty years. "The natives
generally live in families at various intervals of a few miles
down the course of each river and its creeks."<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor" title="J. G. Withnell, loc. cit., p. 8.">[434]</a> "In fact they
are small families constantly moving camp a few miles in any
direction they please."<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[435]</a> In another place we read: "The
natives are divided into many tribes, having their boundaries
defined." These tribes are obviously our local group. The
members thereof live scattered in small parties, called by
Withnell "families." Very interesting is Withnell's information
concerning totemic local centres quite analogous<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor" title="Idem, p. 31.">[436]</a> to those
described by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen. It is important in
our present discussion because it throws light upon the
problem of the connection between an individual or a family
and a certain tract of country. From Withnell's information<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 5, 6.">[437]</a>
it results that among the North-Western tribes there were also
totemic centres, allotted each to a "family" (local group or
part thereof?) at which ceremonies for the multiplication of
the totem were performed. The claim to such centres is
hereditary.</p>

<p>We read in Grey about the tribes of West Australia.
"They appear to live in tribes (= local groups), subject,
perhaps, to some individual authority; and each tribe has a
sort of capital, or head-quarters, where the women and children
remain whilst the men, divided into small parties, hunt and
shoot in different directions. The largest number we saw
together amounted nearly to 200, women and children
<span class="pb" id="Pg147">[147]</span>
included."<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. p. 252.">[438]</a> This directly asserts that the local group lived
in one body; for of course the men were bound to return
always to the head-quarters. Now if we had to assume that
the local group numbered about 200 individuals we could
hardly allow the possibility of obtaining food. Especially
as in another place Grey says: "Landed property does not
belong to a tribe, or to several families, but to a single
male; and the limits of his property are so accurately defined
that every native knows those of his own land, and can
point out the various objects which mark his boundaries."
This land is divided by the father amongst his several sons.
But Grey does not define what proprietorship means. These
two statements are quite inconsistent with each other; if
every man of a big local group had to go to hunt on his own
grounds (and we know that the food area for an Australian
family is not small) they would have to spend their life in
making journeys between their hunting-grounds and head-quarters.
We must either suppose that Grey's tribes were
quite small local groups which lived each on its own territory,
and that when he speaks of from 100 to 200 persons
assembled he refers only to exceptional meetings, or that the
individual ownership of land had no real economic meaning,
and that the natives actually lived in these tribes in more
numerous bodies (perhaps the coastal tribes at least). This
statement is, therefore, not very useful.</p>

<p>Bishop Salvado asserts a subdivision of land among single
families (although he calls "family" a small party of related
natives, see <a href="#Pg257">p. 257</a>) acquired by right of birth.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 265.">[439]</a> Neighbouring
families, small local groups, may enjoy their land in common.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 266.">[440]</a>
Such small parties are quite independent, and governed by
the oldest male.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 267.">[441]</a> They lead, as we may infer from that,
normally a solitary, isolated existence. This statement of
Bishop Salvado is also in agreement with the generality of
our evidence. His "family" is evidently a small local
group. (It reminds us of a similar unit amongst the Kurnai,
also interrelated, owning a portion of land, governed by the
oldest male). He says such small groups have been often
incorrectly called tribes by other authors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bates says the South-West Australians were divided
into tribes or families; "these tribes appear to have been
aggregated into geographical groups ... each occupied a
definite tract of country."<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 53.">[442]</a> But in another place she says that
"each (family) occupied a definite tract of country" with well-marked
<span class="pb" id="Pg148">[148]</span>
boundaries.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 52.">[443]</a> This statement is marred by the lack of
precision in using words like tribes, families, etc. The only
thing that can be made out of it is that there was some local
unit owning a definite tract of country. The right of ownership
is defined by the right of hunting. A man is allowed
to hunt merely his own district. But he has access to his
wife's district too.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 53.">[444]</a></p>

<p>In King George Sound each "tribe" (= local group)
owns a certain district; this is further subdivided among
individual families; each of these portions being hereditary in
a certain family, which is proud of the extensiveness of its
grounds. But all the members of the local group may roam
and hunt over the whole territory. "Under normal conditions
and in its own district the tribe (= local group) is divided
into small parties or families; each party forming a camp of
six or eight wurleys."<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor" title="Browne, loc. cit., pp. 476, 478.">[445]</a> Only on special and important
occasions does the local group aggregate. Strangers are not
admitted to the territory. We see here, again, the actual
proprietor of the land is the local group; families have some
merely formal (or magical) claim to portions of it. The
local group roams in parties, which are nevertheless not so
very small. In from six to eight huts there may live from three
to four families (we must count besides the married couples
also the old people and grown-up children).</p>

<p>Scott-Nind says about the natives of King George Sound,
"An encampment rarely consists of more than seven or eight
huts; for, except the fishing and burning seasons, at which
times large parties assemble together, their numbers are
generally small, and two or three huts suffice. The number of
individuals, however, seldom exceeds fifty."<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 28.">[446]</a> "These encampments
generally consist of near relatives, and deserve
the name of families rather than of tribes."<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[447]</a> Natives who
live together have the exclusive right of fishing or hunting
upon the neighbouring grounds, which are, in fact, divided
into individual properties; the quantity of land owned by each
individual being very considerable. Yet it is not exclusively
his, but others of his family have certain rights over it; so
that it may be considered as partly belonging to the tribe.
The individual owner must be present on his grounds when
the members of his group fire the country for game.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.; compare also p. 44.">[448]</a> We
have here again the local group as real and exclusive land-owner,
the individual having only mere formal rights over
the land. Scott-Nind describes with details how in connection
<span class="pb" id="Pg149">[149]</span>
with and dependence on plentiful food supply, the natives
gather in larger numbers at appropriate seasons.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 36.">[449]</a> He says
in several places that the parties in which the natives live and
roam about number only a few individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Out of the thirty-nine statements collected, thirty-one
describe a certain group or family as owning a definite
tract of country in common; this group is, by definition,
what we called above the local group. But there are
some complications as to its rights of possession over the
given area. On the one hand there is some kind of "over-right"
of the tribe over the district inhabited by all the
local groups of which it is composed.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor" title="Compare G. C. Wheeler, loc. cit., pp. 62-67. In the above statements I did not include explicitly all the contexts referring to this point, as it lies outside our proper field of investigation. It may be found, more or less explicitly, in some of them (J. D. Lang, e. g.). I mentioned it here only to give a fuller account of all aspects under which possession of land presents itself in Australia.">[450]</a> On the other
hand there is a further complication arising from the
alleged individual claims to landed property. As to
the tribal over-right, it presents itself chiefly in the fact
that, first, tribesmen (members of related and friendly
local groups) are often invited and allowed on the territory
of the local group; secondly, in cases of trespass, while
strangers are punished severely (often by death), tribesmen
are only considered slightly culpable. The tribe
may probably sometimes congregate as a whole on a part
of its grounds with the consent of the local group concerned.
We must imagine the local groups of the same
tribe as living in amicable relations and voluntarily
exercising hospitality towards each other, especially
in cases when food is plentiful on their territory.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Wheeler, loc. cit., where this question is thoroughly discussed, and also Curr, pp. 244 sqq., Roth, Bull. 8, p. 9; Salvado, p. 265; Grey, ii. p. 272; Browne, loc. cit., p. 445; G. S. Lang, p. 5.">[451]</a> But as
a general rule the whole tribe neither uses its whole
district, nor has a local group, forming a division of the
tribe, the right to use any but its own territory without
<span class="pb" id="Pg150">[150]</span>
asking permission. The tribal over-right seems therefore
of little importance.</p>

<p>The rights of a local group over its territory are, on the
other hand, the most important form of ownership, and
the only one which possesses economic features. These
rights mean that all members of a local group may roam
over its territory and use all the products, hunt and
collect food and useful objects. In the case of the Central
and North Central tribes we are expressly told that no
individual or family claims may interfere with the rights
that every member of the local group has to the whole
local area. In twenty-one of our thirty-one statements
referring to the right of the local group, we are not told
of any family or individual proprietorship. In the
remaining eight cases single families or male individuals
seem to have some vague claims to special tracts of
country. In three cases the information is ambiguous
on this point. In the case of the Bangerang, Moreton
Bay tribes (J. D. Lang), King George's Sound natives
(Nind and Browne), this right is either of a merely mystic,
intangible character,<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor" title="This mystic character of some individual claims to a particular tract of country appears also from Roth's statement, and from a passage of Oldfield (loc. cit., p. 252). 'Every male is bound to visit the place of his nativity three times a year.' But this writer could not ascertain the purpose of it.">[452]</a> or it is a formal right which gives
to the individual the priority in decisions as to hunting,
burning of grass, etc., and makes him "master of ceremony"
in cases of an assembly on the given spot. In
two instances this individual "land ownership" is stated
to assume a more economic aspect (G. S. Lang and W. E.
Roth). There are, besides, two statements on family
"ownership" which do not mention the local group.
According to one of them (Collins) individual claims to
land have a mystic, fictional character; according to
Grey's statement, individual property in land was the
only positive one; but this latter statement is inconsistent
and does not define the sense of the word "property,"<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Grey, ii. p. 233, and the letter of G. S. Lang quoted by him therein. It appears that both these writers were to a certain extent inspired by a humanitarian tendency, namely to show that the Australian aborigines were not quite without ideas of property in land, and that they were wronged by the white settlers, and thus deserved compensation for the loss of their hunting-grounds. The letter mentioned was written to some humanitarian society. ...">[453]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Pg151">[151]</span>
and is therefore of little weight. So on the whole we have
three statements asserting that landed property of an
economic character was vested in individuals or in single
families respectively. On closer examination, one of
them appears to be quite ambiguous (G. S. Lang), and
another one inconsistent with its context (Grey). Roth's
statement seems to be an exception. He says: "For
one family or individual to obtain, without permission,
vegetable, fowl or meat upon the land belonging to
another family" constitutes a trespass; but then he
adds that owing to their great hospitality each family
readily invites its neighbours and friends to partake of
the products of its land. Roth's statement, although an
exception, deserves to be noted, owing to its explicitness
and to the reliability of the author. It is only regrettable
he does not inform us concerning one point
more, whether these families or individuals respectively
resided usually on their territories and used them exclusively,
or whether they usually aggregated and lived
on each other's domains, every one being only the host
on his own territory. It is only in the first case that
individual proprietorship would have an actual importance;
accepting the second hypothesis, we revert to the
case where the local group (a number of aggregated
families) possesses the actual right of use of the land, the
individuals being only formal landlords of their parcels.
If we accept, on the other hand, the view that single
families were in a purely economic and legal sense owner
of their own tract of land, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> that they enjoyed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usum
<span class="pb" id="Pg152">[152]</span>
fructum</i> of the latter for themselves, and that exclusively,<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor" title="It is well to remember that there cannot be drawn a sharp line of distinction between a 'family' and a 'local group'; moreover, in the use of these terms our authorities are mostly careless and indiscriminate. As to the individual possession of land, it has been pointed out in connection with Howitt's statement on the Wurunjerri, that the individual rights of some influential man (headman) might be the expression of the rights of his local group.">[454]</a>
then we must also believe that the families lived scattered,
and assembled only in exceptional cases. This consequence
is important. But we see easily that although
it is inevitable, supposing actual land ownership in single
families, still the latter state of thing is not a necessary
condition of it. Even when land is invested in the
group, single families may live scattered (compare below).
Claims to land by individuals and families in the Northwestern
Central Queensland tribes were also based on
ideas of a magico-religious character, being probably
a mere magical connection of an individual or family
with a portion of the country. (Compare the statement
from <cite>North Queensland Ethnography</cite>.)</p>

<p>Summing up, there are three different kinds of "proprietorship"
in the aboriginal society; or more correctly
three kinds of claims to, and connections with, a certain
territory. First, actual rights of roaming, hunting,
fishing and digging; these rights belong usually to the
local group (exceptionally, perhaps, to single families or individuals).
Secondly, the customary right of local groups
forming a tribe, mutually to use their hunting-ground;
these forms of proprietorship have been designated
"tribal over-right."<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor" title="In agreement with Mr. Wheeler.">[455]</a> Third, the immaterial claim of
individuals or families to a portion of the local district;
this special right seems to be rather exceptional, and it
appears problematic whether it has any economic character.
In the light of this distinction it can easily be
understood how the actual right of the local group was
modified in two directions. The tribesman was tolerated
on or invited to the ground, whereas the non-tribesman
<span class="pb" id="Pg153">[153]</span>
was killed. On the other hand, individuals or single
families had possibly some claims of an unimportant
character to particular spots. In general, we find it
expressed in nearly all the statements more or less
explicitly that the natives had a very clear idea of the
rights of the local group to its territory, and that the
boundaries of it were respected without exception.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor" title="Compare nearly all of our statements, especially those of Spencer and Gillen, Howitt, Curr. Mr. Wheeler writes in his conclusions (loc. cit., p. 161). 'Territorial conquest is never sought, for the absolute right of the local group to its district is fully recognized.' The respect for boundaries is also stated: in Science of Man, xi. (1910), p. 197 ('tribal' area sharply marked; death is the punishment for trespass). Ibid. (1900), p. 85. Ibid. (1901), p. 9.">[456]</a></p>

<p>We pointed out that the rights of individuals to a
certain tract of country had in general some vague magical
character, and that they were probably always derived
from some mystical relation of the individual to his
birthplace or to another special spot. Now it may be
added that there are hints pointing to the fact that
possession of land in its real form, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> as invested in the
local group, was probably based to a considerable degree
on ideas of religious or magical kind. The information
is unambiguous and detailed on this point as regards the
Central and North-Central tribes. We know of a whole
series of ideas of totemic character that bind a group of
men to a given locality. How far this was valid in the
other parts of the continent it is difficult to decide on the
basis of the information available. But putting side by
side the facts we know about the extremely large area
investigated by Spencer and Gillen, with what we know
of mystic individual rights in other tribes, we are justified
in supposing that everywhere the rights of the local
group (the only ones that present a real economic
character) were the sum or resultant of such individual
rights of magical or religious character, or that the group
as a whole was attached by such ties to its area.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor" title="It is impossible to enlarge here upon this interesting subject, which would require a separate study to itself. The two volumes of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen especially are full of facts, showing that the tribal traditions, the totemic cult, the initiation ceremonies, and all other magical (or religious) functions were intimately bound up with the locality in which a local group lived. The local group itself was, so to say, an offshoot of the local totem centre, the Oknanikilla; ...">[457]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg154">[154]</span>
Now to pass on to the main problem: to the mode of
living. From the previous discussion we may infer that
when the local groups are very small in themselves, then
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> the natives live scattered in very small groups
(Kurnai, probably Murring, Dieri, New South Wales
tribes according to Rob. Dawson, and tribes described by
Salvado).</p>

<p>The same applies to the cases where we are told that
the families own exclusively a certain area (Roth, G. S.
Lang, Grey). But these cases were found to be not quite
beyond question. In some instances when the local group
is a larger unit, and there is no subdivision of land
amongst families, several statements mention that the
natives lived scattered in small groups, varying from two
to four families perhaps. (Murray tribes according to
Eyre; the Central and North-Central tribes according
to Spencer and Gillen; the Moreton Bay tribes according
to J. D. Lang; New South Wales tribes according to
McDougall, Henderson and Hodgkinson; the Kabi and
Wakka, West Australians according to Withnell, Browne,
Scott-Nind.)</p>

<p>In some cases there are reasons for supposing that the
local group was larger (Bangerang, Western Victoria,
at Encounter Bay, on the lakes; perhaps on the sea-shores
in West Australia according to Grey). The remainder
of our information (fifteen statements) does not give any
clear answer to this question. From these approximately
exact data we come to the conclusion that the majority
of tribes lived in small groups of two or three families
<span class="pb" id="Pg155">[155]</span>
of six to nine individuals each, and only in a few tribes
were there larger bodies living in actual daily contact.</p>

<p>To get a more reliable answer on this point it is better
to drop the less clear evidence and to take into consideration
only such as is better and more reliable. If
only the fully reliable and unambiguous statements be
used, there are twelve affirming that aborigines live in
small parties, which in some cases shrink to one family
only (Howitt on the Kurnai; Eyre; R. Dawson; G. S.
Lang; McDougall; Spencer and Gillen in the Central
and North-Central tribes; Henderson; Hodgkinson;
Rev. Matthew on the Kabi and Wakka; Withnell;
Salvado). It should be noted that (1) some of these
authorities are our best informants (Howitt Spencer and
Gillen, Salvado); (2) that the area covered by these
peoples is very extensive, and that the tribes in question
are scattered over the whole continent. The statements
which assert the mode of living in larger bodies are much
less reliable. But it appears undoubted that the statements
of Curr and Dawson, perhaps also those of Meyer,
Schurman and Taplin (confirmed by Angas), are of
quite unquestionable reliability. It is therefore clear
that there were local differences in that respect. And
such a geographical difference in the mode of living
appears quite plausible, from general considerations.
The reasons which must have determined the degree of
aggregation in the Australian tribes were peculiarly
economic ones: the scarcity of food supply was conditioned
partly by the aridity of the soil, partly by the
primitiveness of the means of procuring subsistence.
Where the means of subsistence were plentiful and not
easily exhausted, there larger groups could permanently
aggregate. This was, in the first place, the case where
fishing was at all possible. The Bangerang tribe resided
in two large bodies at the junction of the Glenelg and
Murray rivers; the large group of the Narrinyeri on Lake
Alexandrina; probably the coastal tribes in general were
larger and more sedentary. This seems corroborated by
<span class="pb" id="Pg156">[156]</span>
the fact that they had usually larger and better-built
huts (see below). The same factors would also tend to
produce a more sedentary mode of living (the Bangerang,
the Kurnai (partly at least), and possibly other coastal
tribes). The view that density of population was directly
dependent upon the nature of soil is strengthened by the
direct statements of Wilhelmi, Turnbull, Moorhouse and
Angas.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor" title="The difference in physical geography between the coastal regions and the Central parts, the greater variety in the South-East region in general, and the relations of these physiographical features to the social features of the Australian aboriginal society, are well brought out by Prof. Frazer in his beautifully written chapter on Physical Geography (Tot. and Exog., chap. v. § 1, pp. 314-339). ...">[458]</a></p>

<p>It may be mentioned that in places where, and times
when, plenty of food was available, large numbers of
natives gathered, but only temporarily, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> when a
whale was stranded, or the Bunya-Bunya nuts were ripe,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor" title="Tom Petrie, Reminiscences, chap. i. Besides, compare gatherings at initiation. R. H. Mathews, Proc. R.S.N.S.W., 1904, pp. 114-123. Science of Man, xi., 1910, p. 192. Bunya-Bunya gatherings.">[459]</a> But as the major part of the continent is arid,
we must suppose that the usual mode of living was in
very small groups of one to three families; these groups
being in exceptional cases regular local groups, in the
majority of cases merely portions of them.</p>

<p>Let us briefly examine whether this general assumption
contradicts any other features of Australian tribal
<span class="pb" id="Pg157">[157]</span>
life. If we consider their modes of procuring food,
we find that the women had to go in search of roots,
grubs, etc., in short do purely collecting work. It is
obvious that this kind of work is never done well in big
bands. On the other hand it is probable that one
woman alone would be afraid to go on remote wanderings.
The most favourable unit would be a group of two to
three women with their children. The men hunted their
game also in rather small groups. There do not seem to
be any collective methods of hunting. The kangaroo was
perhaps tired out by the common effort of several men.
For the hunting of the smaller game, which was practically
also a kind of searching, it would be rather unfavourable
to go out in big parties. Considerations of an economic
order, therefore, give no reason for discarding our
assumption; on the contrary it is corroborated by them.
To the question whether for security's sake the aborigines
would not be compelled to aggregate, we must also return
a negative answer. War was not the normal condition of
the Australian blacks.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor" title="Compare G. C. Wheeler, loc. cit., p. 161, and chap. ix. on War, pp. 148 sqq.">[460]</a> And I have not been able to
find any statement of collective methods of organized
defence.</p>

<p>To sum up our results in a few words: the territorial
division points only exceptionally and problematically,
even in these exceptional cases, to possession of land by
single families. The territorial unit, called by us Local
Group, although varying in its extent according to the
locality, appears to consist usually of several families.
But these families in their turn live usually either in
one smaller group, numbering two or three families or,
exceptionally, one only. In more fertile tracts, near
big rivers and fertile coastal districts, the number of
families living in permanent contact appears to be
greater; in the extensive arid areas the number of
families grouped together seems to be rather small.</p>

<h3>II<span class="pb" id="Pg158">[158]</span></h3>

<p>The second part of our problem must now be faced:
whenever there is a certain number of families aggregated
(permanently or temporarily), what are the features
of their social contact in daily life? What are their
dwellings? Do they belong to several families or only
to one? Are there any rules of camping, or do they camp
quite promiscuously? And if there are any customary
rules, of what status are they the expression? Besides
the answers to these questions, we shall find also that
there are rules for occupying the huts, for eating, etc.
In general, all our questions will tend to elucidate
whether there is a quite unlimited, promiscuous social
contact among the members of an aggregate, or whether
there are facts pointing to the isolation and separation of
the individual families. Undoubtedly there is a difference
between aggregation which is merely temporary and that
which is permanent; we shall try to find traces of this
difference indicated in the statements. These latter are
not very rich in information. The facts themselves
seemed perhaps to the majority of our informants much
too commonplace and unimportant. But we owe to some
of the deeper and more conscientious observers highly
interesting details in this connection. More especially this
remark applies to Howitt and some of his correspondents.
We begin with these statements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Statements.</i>&mdash;We have a clear and detailed description of the
mode in which a camp was disposed amongst the Kurnai as well
as of the mode in which a hut was inhabited in this tribe.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Kam. and Kurn., pp. 208-210, and Nat. Tr., pp. 773-776.">[461]</a>
As a rule each hut was inhabited by a man and his
wife. Even if some families<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor" title="I use the word family only in the sense of a man, his wife or wives, and their offspring before reaching puberty.">[462]</a> were closely related,<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor" title="As in the example; Kam. and Kurn., p. 209.">[463]</a> a certain
distance was kept between their camps, which increased
<span class="pb" id="Pg159">[159]</span>
as the consanguinity diminished.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor" title="See this example and diagram in Nat. Tr., p. 774.">[464]</a> A man's parents
could occasionally sleep with him and his wife in the same
hut. But his sister-in-law or his brother would not sleep in
the same hut.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., pp. 209, 210, and Nat. Tr., p. 774.">[465]</a> We see, therefore, that each married couple
occupied a separate hut, and that even near relatives would
not be admitted, especially if sexual jealousy were possible.
In the hut "custom regulates the position of the individual.
The husband and wife would sleep on the left-hand side of the
fire, the latter behind it, and close behind her the children;
nearest to them the little boy, if any, next to him the little
girl";<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor" title="Idem, Nat. Tr., pp. 774, 775. Compare Kam. and Kurn., p. 209.">[466]</a> bigger children camped separately. We shall find
this statement confirmed by another set of facts. Similar
rules and customs applied as well to the Maneroo aborigines
of New South Wales (Murring)<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., p. 210.">[467]</a> as to the Wurunjerri<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 775.">[468]</a> of East
Victoria.</p>

<p>Amongst the Gournditsh-Mara Tribe (Lake Condah, West
Victoria) "each family camped by itself." During the meals
"each wife was ... obliged to sit beside her own husband,"
and not "near any other man unless her husband sat between
them."<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor" title="Rev. Stähle in Kam. and Kurn., pp. 277, 278.">[469]</a> It is a statement pointing to isolation of females
from sex jealousy. We shall meet in the future with a few
statements referring to the way in which meals are taken.</p>

<p>Customs pointing to the isolation of families, on the ground of
sex jealousy are referred to by Curr.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor" title="Recollections, p. 250, refers to the Bangerang tribe. Compare also ibid., p. 256 and A.R., i. pp. 65, 98, 100.">[470]</a> "A woman never sat in
a mia-mia (hut) in which there was a man, save her husband;
she never conversed nor exchanged words with any man
except in the absence of her husband and in reply to some
necessary question," and only from a distance. Women had
"no communication with persons of the opposite sex except
little boys." From the paternal hut, where they lived, "their
brothers of eight or ten years of age were excluded at night."
And again, "among the Bangerang and other tribes I have
known, each married couple had their own mia-mia, or hut."<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor" title="Recollections, p. 259.">[471]</a>
These statements are quite clear. They coincide with the
majority of our information. What is important and will interest
us further in detail is the fact that boys at the age of
about ten were excluded from the paternal hut. Females
were given away about the same age, so that we may say that
<span class="pb" id="Pg160">[160]</span>
only small children remained with their parents. "The
bachelors had one (hut) in common."<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor" title="Compare A.R., i. pp. 109, 110.">[472]</a></p>

<p>Describing the laying of a camp Curr says&mdash;</p>

<p>"As they arrived they formed their camps, each family
having a fire of its own some half-dozen yards from its neighbour's."<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor" title="Recollections, p. 133.">[473]</a></p>

<p>From Dawson's description of the aboriginal habitations,<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 10, 11.">[474]</a>
we get a good glimpse into their mode of dwelling. Dawson
says they have either a permanent or temporary habitation, and
describes both. The former <i>wuurn</i> is bigger, and may accommodate
about a dozen persons. But it serves only for the use of
one family. "When several families live together each builds
its <i>wuurn</i>, facing one central fire." But even the family,
if the children are grown up, does not live in one party;
"the <i>wuurn</i> is partitioned off into compartments. One
of these is appropriated to the parents and children, one to
the young unmarried women and widows, and one to the
bachelors and widowers." Here we see that husband and
wife sleep also quite apart, with their small children.
Grown-up but unmarried male or female children have compartments
of their own. And if they were married they must
have had their own separate camp. The isolation seems to
have been amongst these tribes much less accentuated than
amongst the East Victorians, for instance. Although separated,
grown-up children lived in the same habitation, and even
the <i>wuurns</i> of separate families were situated round a common
fire, so that it "appears to be one dwelling." In their temporary
huts the isolation is more pronounced. "While
travelling or occupying temporary habitations each of these
parties (parent, male and female children) must erect separate
<i>wuurns</i>." Moreover each family must camp separately. A
certain communism of living is expressed also by the common
cooking,<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 17, 20.">[475]</a> although each family has its basket in which it
cooks food.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[476]</a></p>

<p>Eyre's information about the Lower Murray River blacks
agrees to a certain degree with Dawson's statements. "Sometimes
each married man will have a hut for himself, his wives
and family, including, perhaps, occasionally his mother or
some other near relative. At other times, large long huts
are constructed, in which from five to ten families reside,
each having their own separate fire."<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor" title="Eyre, ii. p. 302.">[477]</a> Of course, here the
communism is much greater, although the separation of the
fire circles is still kept. These natives, as well as the tribes
<span class="pb" id="Pg161">[161]</span>
described by Dawson, were in better economic conditions, and
therefore able to adopt sedentary life; they were also more skilful
in the building of huts. The general type of a hut was a
rude shelter of boughs only affording protection against rain.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Curr, A.R., i. p. 97, and Prof. Frazer, Tot. and Exog., i. pp. 321, 322.">[478]</a></p>

<p>Brough Smyth affirms also perfect order and method in
the arrangement of a camp. "The aborigines do not herd
together promiscuously." If the whole tribe is present the
natives are divided into groups each composed of about six
dwellings. "Each mia-mia (hut) is five or six yards distant
from its neighbours." If there are several "tribes" (groups),
each camps in a separate place, in a position marking
whence it came. Each hut has its separate fire (in opposition
to Dawson's statement).<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 124.">[479]</a></p>

<p>Complete isolation and strict camp rules are stated by
J. Moore-Davis. "Married men each with his family occupying
the centre" of the camp.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor" title="Br. Smyth, ii. 318, refers to New South Wales.">[480]</a></p>

<p>A statement quite contrary to nearly all others is given by
Beveridge. He speaks of "the promiscuous manner they have
of huddling together in their loondthals."<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 24.">[481]</a> We need not, however,
take this statement very seriously, as it is given in
immediate connection with another doubtful one, viz. of
absolute, even incestuous, sexual promiscuity.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 23.">[482]</a> Perhaps
the observations were made on natives who were quite corrupted
by contact with white men. At any rate this statement
is directly opposed to all we know about these two features
of Australian aborigines in their natural state of life. We
may therefore discard them as unreliable.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor" title="Beveridge seems to have been in long contact with the aborigines, but he never says in what state of social decomposition they were. In all he writes, although there is some interesting information, there may be seen a lack of accuracy of observation and expression.">[483]</a></p>

<p>Collins writes: "In their huts and in their caves they lie
down indiscriminately mixed, men, women and children
together."<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. p. 555.">[484]</a> This statement is not quite clear, as we do not
know whether these "men, women and children" form one
family, or are related, or whether there is a great number of
them, etc. It is also opposed to what we learnt from Howitt
and many others of the customary order observed in occupying
a hut. Besides, Collins had under his immediate observation
blacks hanging round the town of Port Phillip, demoralized
<span class="pb" id="Pg162">[162]</span>
and degenerate; their females seem to have been already
addicted to prostitution.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. p. 560 and passim.">[485]</a> They were no longer in their primitive
state; and all observations, especially relating to their
mode of living, which changes immediately with the conditions
of life, must be accepted with caution. I do not consider
this statement any more reliable than that of Beveridge
which I discarded. From other passages where he speaks
of the small inland huts "affording shelter to only one
miserable tenant,"<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 555.">[486]</a> and the larger huts on the sea-coast,
"large enough to hold six or eight persons," we might infer
that there was room only for one family in each hut. Here
also we read that the coastal tribes, which probably had a
better food supply and led a more sedentary life, had larger
and better-built huts.</p>

<p>We read concerning the Turra tribe of South Australia<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor" title="Rev. W. J. Kühn in Kam. and Kurn., p. 287.">[487]</a>: "In
camping, the place of the parents is to the right-hand side of
their son's camp; the brother to the left side; sister-in-law
to the right side or near his father's. In the camp the
husband sleeps at the right hand of the fire, his wife behind him,
and her young children behind her." This, less detailed than
Howitt's statement, corroborates it to the full. We see that
each camp is occupied exclusively by a married couple and their
small children; and that inside the hut as well as in the configuration
of the camp there is a strict customary order. It
is important to notice that these statements, reporting strict
camp rules and referring to tribes scattered over a great area
(Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia) are given
by very reliable authorities, and that Howitt at least gathered
them by collecting information about the ancient customs of
the Kurnai and Murring from old natives; using, therefore,
the only correct method. They refer, therefore, to old customs,
which probably were no longer observed in the tribes
spoilt and demoralized by contact with settlers. Much weight
is to be ascribed, therefore, in this matter to the information
of Howitt and his correspondents.</p>

<p>Schürmann states shortly: "Each family occupies a separate
hut; and, if there be any unmarried men, they sleep apart
in a hut of their own."<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor" title="Woods, p. 222.">[488]</a></p>

<p>Henderson says about the New South Wales natives,
"Each family has its own gunya and fire."<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 109.">[489]</a></p>

<p>George Barrington observes that among the Port Jackson
natives each hut was occupied by one family.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 82.">[490]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg163">[163]</span>
When the families who formed a "tribe" (= local group?) meet
"each family has its own fire and provides its own substance."<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor" title="R. Dawson, p. 327. Port Stephens Blacks.">[491]</a>
In the description of his travels Dawson tells us that when
the native party was joined by a stranger with his wife
the latter did not approach the other men, but slept alone
by herself at a small fire.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 249.">[492]</a> This points to the fact that a
married woman normally never slept in the immediate neighbourhood
of any other man but her own husband.</p>

<p>Spencer and Gillen affirm, again, the complete isolation of
families who, according to them,<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 18.">[493]</a> normally roam scattered
on the territory of the local group. "Each family, consisting
of a man and one or more wives and children, occupies
always a mia-mia, which is merely a lean-to of shrubs,
so placed as to shield the occupants from the prevailing
wind." This statement is perfectly clear, and we may fit
it into the general picture we drew from all the other
evidence.</p>

<p>Among the natives of Central Australia (probably of the
Arunta nation) a married woman "may speak to any but the
young men."<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor" title="J.A.I., xxiv. p. 183 (W. H. Willshire in Prof. Frazer's Questions).">[494]</a> Thus she is practically excluded from any
intercourse with them.</p>

<p>Among the natives of Moreton Bay the conjugal relation
is maintained by them "with great decency and propriety,
every family having its separate hut and fire."<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor" title="J. D. Lang, loc. cit., p. 337.">[495]</a></p>

<p>A very clear and concise statement is given on this point
by the Rev. J. Mathew, referring to the Kabi and Wakka
tribes. "The family, consisting of husband and wife, or wives,
with their children, constituted a distinct social unit. They
occupied the same gunya (dwelling), they ate together,
they travelled together."<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 153.">[496]</a> After having described the construction
of the hut he adds: "This sufficed for a family.
The dwellings were placed a little distance apart, facing
in the same direction, and each had its own small fire in
front."<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 84.">[497]</a></p>

<p>Roth says about the tribes of North-West Central Queensland:
"The husband sleeps in the same gundi as his wives."<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor" title="Eth. Stud., p. 182, § 327.">[498]</a>
The way of taking meals is not quite uniform among all tribes
observed by this writer. At Cape Bedford "members of one
family take their meals together, except the single young men
(above puberty), who dine apart." In another tribe (Tully
<span class="pb" id="Pg164">[164]</span>
River) "each family dines by itself." On the contrary, "on the
Bloomfield River men, boys and girls (up to four or five years
of age) dine together; all the other females ... mess apart."<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor" title="Bull. iii. p. 7.">[499]</a>
Among the natives of Koombana Bay, "in the family, the man,
women and children dined together."<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor" title="Proc. R.S.Q., p. 48.">[500]</a> There are three kinds
of huts among the North Queensland tribes: the simple shelter
of boughs; a hut built somewhat more carefully against rain;
and a hut built for protection against cold, this hut, being of
course, the most elaborate.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor" title="Eth. Stud., §§ 159, 160, 161, pp. 105-107.">[501]</a> From the description of these
huts we may infer that they were occupied each by one family
only.</p>

<p>The isolation of families caused by the jealousy of the
husband is plainly stated by Grey: "He cannot, from the
roving nature of their mode of life, surround his wives with
the walls of a seraglio, but custom and etiquette have drawn
about them barriers nearly as impassable. When a certain
number of families are collected together, they encamp at a
common spot, and each family has a separate hut or perhaps
two. At these huts sleep the father of the family, his wives,
the female children who have not yet joined their husbands,
very young boys<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., ii. p. 252.">[502]</a> and occasionally female relatives; but no
males over ten years of age may sleep in family huts. They
have got their own separate encampment."<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[503]</a> If any strangers
are present with their wives, they sleep in their own huts,
placed amongst the married people. If they are unmarried
or without wives "they sleep at the fire of the young men."<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[504]</a>
"Under no circumstances is a strange native allowed to approach
the fire of a married man."<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 252, 253.">[505]</a> Their huts being so
scattered over a rather large area, their conversation is held
by means of a loud chant.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 253.">[506]</a> It must be remembered that Grey
asserts in several places the great and vigilant jealousy of the
natives.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 242, 253, 255.">[507]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Salvado, who speaks also of the great jealousy of the
males and the fidelity exacted from the females,<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 279.">[508]</a> gives us
the following account of their mode of camping: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Lorsqu'une
famille se dispose à dormir, les garçons qui ont passé l'âge
de sept ans dorment seuls, autour du feu commun, les plus
petits avec le père, et les enfants à la mamelle, aussi bien que
les filles, quel que soit leur âge, avec la mère. Les femmes
jouissent du droit d'ancienneté, la première dort plus près
du mari, ainsi de suite."</span><a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 280.">[509]</a> Another passage<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor" title="Salvado, loc. cit., p. 317.">[510]</a> testifies also
<span class="pb" id="Pg165">[165]</span>
that they roam in single families; the reason alleged is easier
food supply.</p>

<p>We read in Browne that one hut holds only two or three
persons.<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor" title=" Loc. cit., p. 448.">[511]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The general inference to be drawn from these twenty-four
statements is, roughly speaking, that the general
features of native camp arrangements were orderliness,
fixed rules, isolation of families, settled and restricted
social contact, and by no means social communism and
unregulated social promiscuity.</p>

<p>Five instances give strict rules which obtain in arranging
camps. These were probably much more widespread
than might be supposed from these few instances. But,
as mentioned above, these camp rules would probably
fall into abeyance at once when the natives came in contact
with civilization. It was only by attentive inquiries
that Howitt extracted them from the natives. Besides
these we read in fifteen statements that each family
camped separately. So that twenty of twenty-four
statements assert that there was in this respect complete
isolation of the families. Sexual motives played undoubtedly
an important part in this isolation. We are
told so expressly in several places (Curr, Grey, Salvado,
J. D. Lang). In the case of even friendly strangers a
certain amount of mistrust&mdash;of evil magic as well as of
actual bad intentions&mdash;may have operated. There are
indications of it in statements of Br. Smyth and Grey.
But in the detailed examples given by Howitt, where
all the camping families are closely related and usually
consist of more than one generation (father and sons,
etc.), we can hardly conceive that either of the above-mentioned
motives would come into play. At any rate
this regulated camp order shows how important this
question was in the native social life and how strong the
idea must have been that each family had its own place
apart from the others, and the more remotely related
people were, the less intimate contact would be.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg166">[166]</span>
The aborigines possess different kinds of huts. Of
interest for us is the fact that the majority of them are
made to hold only one family. Fourteen statements
assert it explicitly or implicitly. In three instances we
are told of the existence of larger huts (Eyre, Dawson,
Collins). In two of them the separation of families is
maintained in spite of the larger dwellings. Only Collins'
information is doubtful in this respect.</p>

<p>Within these huts the family camped according to
fixed rules. We have five instances given by Howitt and
his correspondents, and Bishop Salvado. These rules
show clearly that each hut, each fire-place, was reserved
for one family, and that this <em>status</em> had its customary form
and sanction. There were three instances of separation
during meals (Gournditsh-Mara, some of the North-West
Central Queensland tribes, and the Kabi and Wakka).
In three statements we are told that both sexes separated
during meals (Curr, Angas, Roth). What Curr tells us
of the marked social separation of families is remarkable;
especially in respect to the isolation of the women.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor" title="It is well to notice here that the isolation of families was closely connected with the isolation of both sexes. The men were in contact only with their wives and perhaps with their near female relatives. That this isolation cannot be due to motives of sexual jealousy is certain; it is in great part due to the dread of evil magic. But to work out this question would lead us too far. Compare Howitt, Nat. Tr., pp. 776, 777.">[512]</a></p>

<p>Two statements were rather in contradiction with our
general results: Beveridge's statement of promiscuous
huddling and Collins' vague information. We stated our
reasons for not giving them much weight, and they cannot
outweigh the sum-total of reliable information which is
fairly unanimous on this point. It is also in general
agreement with the information we gathered on sexual
matters as well as with our conclusion as to territorial
distribution, and it corroborates our results on both these
points. For on the one hand it was found that in normal
life there exists individuality of sexual relations; on the
other hand the usual scattered mode of living would
<span class="pb" id="Pg167">[167]</span>
correspond to a fairly complete isolation in cases of
tribal assembly.</p>

<p>Our last considerations have clearly demonstrated how
the individuality of the family unit shows itself in the
aboriginal mode of living. A single family is normally
in contact with a few other families only; sometimes it
roams alone over its own area. But even when there are
several families living together, the camp rules keep them
apart from each other in nearly every function of daily
life. The children, who live in intimate contact with
their parents in the same hut, must necessarily set them
apart from all their (the children's) other relatives. We
must assume, therefore, that the individuality of the
relation of each child to its actual parents is deeply
impressed by all the circumstances of daily life on the
child's mind. This assumption is in accord with the
information we can gather on this point. But before
we begin to look it through, let us discuss the theoretical
side of the kinship (or relationship) problem.</p>

<small>DISCUSSION OF KINSHIP</small></h2>

<h3>I<br />
<small><span class="smcap">Theoretical Analysis of this Concept</span></small></h3>

<p>It is undoubtedly one of the most valuable discoveries
arrived at by modern sociological science that each institution
varies in accordance with the social environment
in which it is found. A given institution or social form
(like the family, the state, the nation, the church) appears
under various forms in different societies, and among
peoples with a very low culture only rudiments thereof
may be expected. This point of view, applied to marriage
and the family, has led some writers to the assumption
of forms as much opposed to those usual in our societies,
as promiscuity and group marriage is opposed to individual
marriage and the family. Nevertheless, although the
variability and multiplicity of forms of marriage and
family were acknowledged, the concepts applied to them
were still the old ones, directly borrowed from our own
society and formed upon the facts found amongst ourselves.
In particular the sociologically untrained ethnographers
comprehended the phenomena of kinship only
under our own social concepts, judged them according
to our own moral standard, and described them with
words the meaning of which ought to have been defined
when applied to a new case; nevertheless these terms
have been nearly always used by ethnographers in the
same sense in which we use them amongst ourselves,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> as expressing ideas of community of blood through
<span class="pb" id="Pg169">[169]</span>
procreation.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor" title="Compare, for instance, Morgan, Systems, pp. 108 sqq. For other examples see below, pp. 199 sqq. Sir Laurence Gomme writes: 'One of our greatest difficulties, indeed, is the indiscriminate use of kinship terms by our descriptive authorities.'--Loc. cit., p. 235.">[513]</a> That this is quite erroneous will be shown
below. How far the idea of kinship changes from society
to society, what are its essential invariable features, and
what are the variable elements&mdash;these are the problems
that must be set forth.</p>

<p>The inadequacy of our ideas of kinship as applied to lower
societies has been often felt by those ethnographers who
wished to enter deeper into the problems of kinship
among a given people. They have found the greatest
difficulty in conveying to a European reader the meaning
of different terms of relationship. While warning the reader
to put aside our (the modern European) ideas of kinship,
they have hardly succeeded in giving any definite and clear
concept instead. The reasons for this failure are simple:
our ideas of kinship are defined by certain facts which are
not to be found in the given primitive society. In order
to define kinship so as to fit the latter, the author
ought to bring forward a series of facts, playing a part
analogous in the given society to that played by the
essential defining elements amongst us. But it is by no
means easy to know among which facts to look for such
analogous, defining elements. And here again arises the
necessity of a general definition of kinship, one which
would afford indications in what direction to search for
social facts giving a right idea of kinship in any given
society. Such a general definition would be like an
algebraic formula, having its constant and its variable
terms; if for the latter special data be inserted (in this
instance the special conditions proper to the given society),
the special value for any given case is obtained (namely
the special concept of kinship proper to the given society).
And it should also be indicated within what range the
variables should be taken; in other words, in what facts
the elements which specifically determine kinship in the
<span class="pb" id="Pg170">[170]</span>
given society must be looked for. The practical value of
such a general definition of kinship is obvious. On the
one hand it indicates the constant elements in kinship
common to all societies; on the other hand it indicates
the general character of the variable elements, and the
way in which they must be looked for and worked into
the general formula.</p>

<p>By the word kinship, roughly speaking, is denoted a
series of family relationships (those of parents to children,
brothers to sisters, etc.), all of which consist of a set of
extremely complex phenomena. They are made up of
the most heterogeneous elements: physiological (birth,
procreation, suckling, etc.), social (community of living,
of interests, social norms, etc.), and psychological (different
ways in which these relations are conceived, different
moral ideas, and different types of feelings). Special care
must be taken to select in all these elements the essential
ones, as an omission would be just as fatal for the
investigations as an overburdening with secondary
elements. Moreover, it would be specially valuable to
look at all these heterogeneous determining elements
from the same point of view, and view them all under one
and the same aspect. Leaving on one side the purely
physiological problem of kinship,<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor" title="This would be the place to point out the biological meaning of the social aspects of kinship and family; whether, e. g. the different social regulations of sexual intercourse, which in higher societies afford the basis to kinship, the different forms of family and kinship are the expression of biological laws. How far such would be possible could only be decided on the basis of a biological knowledge which the present writer does not possess.">[514]</a> it appears necessary
to give a sociological view of kinship, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> to show the
social bearing of physiological facts as well as of psychological
elements. But it appears also necessary to
view the whole of the phenomena of kinship from the
psychological point of view; that is, to show how the sociological
and physiological facts of kinship are reflected
in the "collective mind" of the given society.</p>

<p>Besides for other reasons (adduced below) this appears
<span class="pb" id="Pg171">[171]</span>
necessary, because one of the most important scientific
uses that has been made of the different human systems
of kinship is one that presupposes a certain definite
meaning, as given to the terms of kinship in very low
societies. In Morgan's deductions a very important part
is played by the assumption that kinship is always understood
in terms of consanguinity; in particular that it was
understood thus by primitive man; that in all (even the
lowest) societies all ideas of kinship were essentially
based upon the community of blood, established in
the case of the mother by her share in bearing, in that
of the father by his part in procreation. Only by
assuming that these facts were known to the lowest,
prehistoric savages, could Morgan draw inferences from
systems of kinship terms about the forms of sexual
intercourse. If, on the other hand, the relation between
sexual intercourse and birth escaped the knowledge of
primitive men, they could not have based their idea of
kinship upon community of blood between father and
offspring; hence there could be no connection between
forms of sexual intercourse and forms of kinship as
conceived by primitive man. Whether there could be
connection between marriage, defined sociologically, and
kinship is another and more complicated problem. In
any case Morgan uses throughout his book the word
consanguinity, and he defines it as the tie of common
blood arising from the sexual act. In other words he
sets forth the problem in a simplified and incorrect form.
The question how kinship may be conceived in a given
society, especially in a low one, naturally presents itself
as a very important point of investigation.</p>

<p>As in the following pages there will be question more or
less exclusively of the individual relation between parents
and children, the present discussion may be fittingly
restricted to the individual parental kinship in Australia.
In the second part of this chapter facts giving some insight
into the aboriginal collective ideas of kinship are
set forth; and in the following chapter other different facts
<span class="pb" id="Pg172">[172]</span>
will be brought forward in order to complete the definition
of <em>individual parental kinship</em>. But in accordance with
what has been just said, it is needful to have some guiding
principle in collecting this material, and this will now be
looked for. This discussion, being only concerned with
the Australian facts, does not pretend to be complete, but
perhaps if the results are worked out so as to suit our
modern European concept of kinship as well as the Australian
one, it might, should it be correct, be applicable
also to other societies.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor" title="Of course by result is meant a general formula for kinship.">[515]</a> Let us now proceed to give the
general definition of kinship and in the first place to indicate
which are its constant, uniform factors found in
all societies.</p>

<p>Amongst the heterogeneous factors which together
make up parental kinship, the physiological facts appear
to be the most constant, for the natural process of
procreation is in all human societies the same. But the
social consequences of this process vary very widely
according to other variable elements, as will appear clearly
below in our discussion of consanguinity. Part of them
only, together with some social elements, may be taken
as the uniform, constant basis of kinship, such as must
serve for the first point of departure in an attempt to
discuss more in detail the kinship in any society. It
appears probable that this basis is given by the existence
of a group formed by a woman, her husband, and the
children whom she has borne, suckled and reared. The
existence of such a group will be considered as the necessary
and sufficient condition for <em>individual parental kinship</em>.
Where such a group exists we are justified in affirming that
individual parental kinship exists, although it is not
yet completely defined thereby; further facts must be
adduced in order to complete the definition. Those
further facts are precisely the variable terms in the
general formula of kinship; it remains still to indicate
their general character. But a few words must be first
said about the constant factors of kinship just mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg173">[173]</span>
They consist in the existence of the individual family
group as determined by individual marriage and by
individual motherhood. Individual motherhood means
that the same woman who gave birth to a child stands to
it in a special close relation in its later life also: she suckles
it and rears it, and she is bound to him or her by the
manifold ties resulting from the community of life and
community of interests. This woman is bound on the
other hand to a man by individual marriage; and thereby
her children are bound to him also; and the mother, her
husband, and her children form the social unit called the
individual family. The existence of such a unit is to be
established by showing its different social functions, and
the different ways in which its solidarity and individuality
are marked in a given society. It is clear that the
position of the father is in this way first established
socially only, as the husband of the children's mother.
Nevertheless it must be borne in mind that thus his
relation to the children is clearly marked; and that this
is only a preliminary, so to say formal, determination of
fatherhood, which in all societies appears to be much more
materially defined by other factors, discussed hereafter.</p>

<p>The existence of the individual family as a social unit,
based upon the physiological facts of maternity, the social
factor of marriage and other social factors, are thus chosen
as the basis upon which we may proceed to analyze more
in detail the individual parental relation. Whether this
basis exists in all human societies and forms what was
called above the constant, invariable elements of parental
kinship, may remain an open question. This could
only be answered correctly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a posteriori</i>, on the basis
of a series of special researches in many societies.
The existence of individual motherhood, as this word
is defined here, seems to obtain in the majority of human
societies (or even in all of them). Nevertheless, as
pointed out above,<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor" title="In reference to Dr. Rivers' article, compare pp. 6, 7.">[516]</a> even this point cannot be treated
as self-evident. This applies in still higher degree to
<span class="pb" id="Pg174">[174]</span>
individual marriage, which has often been denied as
regards many societies.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor" title="In some cases, when the position of the father is very subordinate in the family and his relation to the mother and her children is a very loose one--it seems doubtful whether the existence of the individual family (in the sense here defined) can be accepted (compare, for examples of such peoples, Dr. Westermarck, H.H.M., p. 109, and Sir Laurence Gomme, loc. cit., pp. 231, 232). In these cases the necessary condition for individual paternal kinship according to our theory would be lacking.">[517]</a> In this place we have mainly
to keep before our eyes the Australian society and our
own society, the latter of which affords, so to say, the
heuristic principle, the clue to the understanding of the
former. As far as those two societies are concerned, our
choice appears to be the right one, and the social-physiological
basis mentioned above contains the essential
common elements of kinship in both societies.</p>

<p>The existence of individual marriage and its legal,
sexual and psychological aspects have been discussed and
established in the preceding chapters, as far as Australia
is concerned. A discussion on individual motherhood
will be given below. The existence of the individual
family group in Australia, based upon individual marriage
and upon individual motherhood, is the subject of the
remaining chapters of this study. So that the existence
of this physiological and social basis of kinship may be
taken as granted.</p>

<p>Bearing now in mind that what will be said hereafter
applies in the first place to Australia, it may be
said that in the physiological and social basis of kinship
adopted above, the minimum of conditions necessary
for the application of the idea of individual kinship
was enumerated. But this minimum is not sufficient
to determine this idea completely in any given society.
By studying only the social facts which determine the
individuality of family life within the society, we
should not exhaust all the features and essential
aspects of parental kinship in any society. The existence
of the individual family merely indicates unambiguously
that individual parental kinship exists in the
<span class="pb" id="Pg175">[175]</span>
given society. For this social unit having a deep analogy
with our own individual family, the relation between the
members of both these social units must also have some
deep resemblance. But to exaggerate this resemblance
would be as erroneous as to deny it. Besides the features
common both to our parental kinship and to that of the
Australian, there are also those which differentiate these
two relationships. They must be sought for in the differences
in the <em>social conditions</em>, which may even modify
the physiological basis of kinship, as for instance when
physical fatherhood is in one society established beyond
doubt by exclusive sexual appropriation, while in the
other there can be no question of it, owing to sexual
communism. The variations in the general social conditions
obviously also affect the purely sociological side of
kinship. To point this out clearly, it is enough to mention
that each relation is subject to the normative influences of
the society in the midst of which it exists, and these norms
and their sanction vary with the general social structure.</p>

<p>The variable elements in parental kinship must be also
looked for in the different elements of the <em>collective mind</em>,
connected with the parental relationship; in other words,
in the different <em>collective ideas</em> and <em>feelings</em> which have
parental kinship for their centre. Moreover, as mentioned
above, there are reasons why the knowledge of the
collective idea of kinship is sociologically important.
It may be emphasized here that we should cripple and
curtail our knowledge if we arbitrarily abstained from
inquiring what influence the collective knowledge as to
procreation, consanguinity, affinity, etc., may have upon
the social aspect of the relation in question.</p>

<p>The same thing may be said of another domain of
collective mentality: that is, of the feelings involved in
parental kinship. The type of feelings underlying this
relationship may vary with the society, in the same way
as these feelings vary with each individual case in any
given society. And as these feelings essentially determine
the character of parental kinship in any given society, it
<span class="pb" id="Pg176">[176]</span>
appears that the discussion of this point cannot be omitted.
Thus into the general formula of kinship there must enter
also the psychological elements: collective ideas, expressing
in a given society what is kinship, what are its
legal, moral and customary aspects; and the collective
feelings prevailing in a given society. From the interaction
of these psychological elements with different
variable social elements arise the more special, peculiar
factors which define kinship in any given society. In
other words, the variable elements in the general formula
of kinship are seen to arise chiefly from the collective
psychological interpretation and valuation of some of the
physiological and social facts underlying parental kinship.</p>

<p>To sum up, it may be said that parental kinship is the
personal tie obtaining between members of the <em>parental

it must be further determined in each society by the
characteristic <em>collective feelings</em> and <em>collective ideas</em> which
in the given society give it its specific meaning.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor" title="This definition may appear a commonplace and a truism, a mere formulation of what is obvious to every one at first sight. But it is liable to this objection only when taken formally, i. e. when only its form is considered, because it contains in the words parental group (individual family) the substance of all that has been said in the preceding pages about this social unit; ...">[518]</a> This is
that general formula of kinship which will yield us what
we have demanded of it&mdash;that is, an indication of the
facts for which to look in any given society. As the facts
referred to in the first part of the above definition (the
establishment of the existence of the family unit) are
dealt with in the remaining chapters, it is necessary to
discuss only the second part of the definition.</p>

<p>The influence upon kinship of the beliefs and ideas as
to procreation appears quite plainly upon an analysis
of the concept of consanguinity, and to this we may devote
a few words.</p>

<p>Parental kinship is in our society conceived invariably
<span class="pb" id="Pg177">[177]</span>
and exclusively in terms of <em>consanguinity</em>,<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor" title="Legal adoption being set apart as a case which only partly establishes the kinship relations.">[519]</a> or, speaking
more explicitly, parental kinship is conceived as established
by the tie of common blood, resulting from birth
(maternal kinship) or procreation (paternal kinship). Of
course the mere physiological fact does not establish
kinship in its full extent, with all its personal, emotional,
social and legal aspects. It is only when the physiological
facts of procreation or birth are sanctioned by society,
in other words when they are consummated in legal
marriage, that the children are full kinsmen of both their
parents. Society takes all facts which are of vital
importance for itself under its own supervision; and
consequently the important facts of propagation are
subject to the control of society, which regulates them by
a series of religious, legal, customary and conventional
norms, all of which are also necessary conditions and
essential features of full parental kinship. But this
sanction once granted, the tie of common blood is conceived
as the main source of all mutual duties and moral
and legal obligations; and from this also outflow the
feelings of love, attachment, reverence, and so forth,
which are in our society the essential features of parental
kinship. Once a man knows that a child, which he considered
his own, is in reality not begotten by him, undoubtedly
all his feelings for this child are affected, and,
under certain conditions, its legal position may be modified.
The two conditions for full parental kinship in our
society are (1) that the child be the real physiological
offspring of both presumed parents; (2) that it be legally
begotten or its birth legalized.</p>

<p>In our society the line of distinction between physiological
consanguinity and social consanguinity is quite
clear; the one is a mere physiological fact,<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor" title="It seems hardly necessary to emphasize that for physiological consanguinity as such, pure and simple, there is no room in sociological science.">[520]</a> the other the
<span class="pb" id="Pg178">[178]</span>
social acknowledgment of this fact and all its consequences,
subject to certain norms, laid down by society.</p>

<p>There are two separate sets of circumstances in which
we may speak of consanguinity: (1) the existence of social
institutions, which allow us to trace the physiological
blood ties (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> monogamy or harem institutions), in which
case we can speak of the existence of physiological consanguinity
as obtaining between the members of the
individual family. (2) The existence of a social acknowledgment
of the facts of procreation as creating ties of
individual personal kinship, in which case we may speak
of social consanguinity. If neither of these conditions
are fulfilled, then it would be quite meaningless to speak
of consanguinity.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor" title="Keeping to the definition of this word as given above. It is a question of mere convention whether we call the general relationship not necessarily based upon ideas of community of blood kinship, as is done here, or whether we call it social in opposition to physical kinship, as does M. A. van Gennep. ...">[521]</a></p>

<p>Now let us see whether these conditions are to be found
in all human societies. That both are found in the
majority of the more highly developed societies appears
beyond doubt. But this seems not to be the case in the
lower societies. Even a superficial glance at them is
sufficient to prove it. Whereas, in some of the lowest
peoples known conjugal fidelity seems to be the rule,<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor" title="Dr. Westermarck writes: 'There are numerous savage and barbarous peoples among whom sexual intercourse out of wedlock is of rare occurrence; unchastity at least on the part of the woman being looked upon as a disgrace and even as a crime' (Westermarck, H.H.M., p. 61). In support of his opinion he adduces some forty cases where chastity is considered a virtue. ...">[522]</a>
and consequently the physiological tie of blood between
<span class="pb" id="Pg179">[179]</span>
children and both their parents is secured, in other societies
of low culture the sexual laxity is so great that there is
no possibility at all of tracing the descent of a child from
any individual man.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor" title="For various examples of various peoples besides the Australians, see Westermarck, pp. 71, 81. Compare also Post, Ethnologische Jurisprudenz, i. pp. 17 sqq., and Dargun, loc. cit., pp. 9 sqq.">[523]</a> This applies in the first place to
the majority of the Australian tribes, as is shown in the
chapter on sexual matters. In consequence, it may be
said that in many low societies, and especially in some of
the Australian tribes, there is no possibility of speaking
of physiological consanguinity as regards the father.</p>

<p>How does the case stand with the social importance
attributed to the facts of procreation? Here the variation
seems to be still greater. This can be very well
exemplified by the Australian material. Over the greater
part of the continent the father's share in procreation is
not known. There cannot be any social acknowledgment
of it. Consanguinity in its social sense does not exist. In
some tribes of South-East Australia, on the other hand,
the mother's share in procreation is under-rated; the
father is considered to be the only consanguineous relative;
the child is the father's offspring only, the mother being
merely its nurse. Here the consanguineous relation
between mother and child is considerably reduced in social
importance, and consanguinity as it appears to the social
mind is purely paternal. It may be said, therefore, that
paternal kinship in the Centre and the North of the continent
and maternal kinship in the South-Eastern tribes
cannot be called consanguinity (in the social sense of this
word), although in both cases very close kinship exists,
as will appear from a detailed discussion hereafter.</p>

<p>These examples show clearly that it would be incorrect
to treat physiological consanguinity as a constant and
indispensable constituent of parental kinship.</p>

<p>Besides these Australian examples<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor" title="Which are dealt with at length in the second part of this chapter.">[524]</a> there may be
adduced many cases from other societies in which the ties
<span class="pb" id="Pg180">[180]</span>
of blood play no part in the collective ideas of kinship.
The Naudowessies have the curious idea that their offspring
are indebted to their father for their souls, the
invisible part of their essence, and to the mother for their
corporeal and visible part.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor" title="Westermarck, loc. cit., p. 105.">[525]</a> Here the father's part in
procreation was probably known, but the interpretation
thereof was not the correct physiological one, but one that
created, so to say, a spiritual connection as the bond of
paternal kinship, whereas maternal kinship was conceived
in terms of consanguinity. On the other hand, "according
to Kafir ideas a child descends chiefly, though not
exclusively, from the father"<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 106.">[526]</a>&mdash;a belief analogous to that
of the South-East Australians. The same belief was held
in several higher societies (Egyptians, Hindoos, Greeks).<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[527]</a>
Dargun has made a list of peoples among whom the
(social) father of the children is quite indifferent as to
whether they are really begotten by him.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 9-18.">[528]</a> Among the
Todas, where the determination of paternity is quite out
of the question, owing to their polyandry, fatherhood is
determined only by the performance of a conventional
ceremony (the rite of <i>pursütpimi</i>, or handing over to the
pregnant woman a miniature bow and arrow). This
constitutes fatherhood; the man who has performed this
ceremony is the (social) father of the child, even if it were
certain that he had not begotten it.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor" title="Rivers, The Todas, pp. 517 sqq.">[529]</a> Another interesting
case was discovered by Dr. Rivers amongst the Banks
Islanders. There fatherhood is determined by the fact
of paying the midwife.</p>

<p>But the most noteworthy cases in regard to the present
subject are those where fatherhood in its social sense is
not consanguineous owing to the ignorance of the physiological
laws of reproduction (a state of things mentioned
already as obtaining in Central Australia). This ignorance
is of general sociological importance, because there
are well-founded reasons for believing that it was once
<span class="pb" id="Pg181">[181]</span>
universal amongst primitive mankind, as may be held
to be proved by Mr. E. S. Hartland in his thorough
treatise on <cite>Primitive Paternity</cite>. For the detailed argument
the reader must be referred to this fundamental
work.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor" title="Mr. Sidney Hartland has given an exceedingly exhaustive collection of stories 'of birth other than what we know as the only natural cause'; of customs in which the 'means to which in these stories birth is attributed are or have been actually adopted for the production of children'; and he has compared this folkloristic material with the Australian beliefs. ...">[530]</a> Mr. Sidney Hartland has besides drawn sociological
conclusions from those facts in their bearing upon
paternal kinship. In Chapter IV of the first volume he
gives numerous examples of peoples among whom there
is no tie of consanguinity between father and son.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor" title="How far Mr. Hartland's results appear incomplete on the sociological side will be discussed hereafter.">[531]</a></p>

<p>To ascertain the influence of physiological ties of blood
on this relation in a given society it is needful to know the
way in which they present themselves to the aboriginal
mind. That is, we must know the collective ideas of
a given society on the facts of procreation. Do they
know, or do they not know, the father's part in procreation?
But this is not sufficient. Even if they know
a certain physiological fact, they may not acknowledge
its bearing upon kinship, they may attach no importance
to its social aspect. So it is with the fact of physiological
maternity in the South-East Australian tribes and
with paternity in the cases quoted by Dargun. And it
happens very often that in peoples where the causal connection
<span class="pb" id="Pg182">[182]</span>
between copulation and pregnancy is well known,
fatherhood is by no means determined by its physiological
aspect. Not only the collective knowledge of the physiological
facts, but also the collective attitude towards them,
must therefore be taken into consideration.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor" title="Sir Laurence Gomme writes: 'There is a wide difference between the mere physical fact of having a mother and father, and the political fact of using this kinship for social organization. Savages who have not learned the political significance have but the scantiest appreciation of the physical fact. The Australians, for instance, have no term to express the relationship between mother and child. This is because the physical fact is of no significance....' (loc. cit., p. 232).">[532]</a> In short,
it may be said that <em>physiological</em> consanguinity has no
direct bearing upon social facts.</p>

<p>To define consanguinity in its social meaning, the
collective ideas held by a given society on the facts of
procreation must be considered. Consanguinity, therefore,
is the set of relations involved by the collective
ideas under which the facts of procreation are viewed
in a given society. And it must be borne in mind that
these ideas express not only the purely theoretical views
of the social mind on the facts of procreation; they
also involve different emotional elements, and especially
the social importance given to these facts by society.
Consanguinity (as a sociological concept) is therefore not
the physiological bond of common blood; it is the social
acknowledgment and interpretation of it.</p>

<p>It may be said, therefore, that consanguinity is not
always considered as the essence of kinship. If now we
wish to determine what are the common features of the
different ideas which in different societies define kinship,
the only answer is that the said ideas affirm in one way or
another a very close, intimate tie between offspring and
parents. These ideas may refer kinship to physiological
facts (consanguinity as found in the major part of human
societies); or they may base kinship on the performance
of a quite conventional ceremony (Todas, Banks Islanders);
or they may affirm a very close tie between parent and
child, on the base of some religious or magic belief (spiritual
<span class="pb" id="Pg183">[183]</span>
tie, transmission of soul: the Naudoweissies and some
Australian tribes, as will be seen below). It is evident,
therefore, that the general idea of kinship cannot be
construed in terms of any of these special sets of ideas.
The essential features that must be claimed for these ideas
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> those ranged in the class of kinship ideas) are:
(1) that they must refer to the relation between child and
father or mother;<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor" title="The terms child, father and mother being defined first broadly as explained above, pp. 172 sqq.">[533]</a> and (2) that they must affirm an
intimate bond of union of some kind between the parties
involved. As may be easily conceived, it will be difficult
in very low societies to get hold of these ideas, that is, to
obtain the exact answer to the question, "What is kinship?"
It is now impossible even to measure exactly
the difficulty of getting a precise answer to this question,
as ethnographers have never paid special attention to this
point. Nevertheless, in Australia we shall be able to get
at least some glimpses, which are of the highest theoretical
interest. And even the negative result&mdash;that the idea of
consanguinity must be considered wanting in the majority
of Australian tribes&mdash;is of considerable theoretical value.</p>

<p>Besides the general question, "What is considered as
the source of parental (maternal and paternal) kinship?"
we may ask questions about the various other ideas connected
with kinship. Here come in the legal, moral, and
customary ideas, by which society exercises its normative
power in reference to the said relation. Some of these are
expressed in different social functions.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor" title="As an example may be quoted the 'functions of kinship' described by Dr. Rivers for the Torres Straits Islanders. Cambridge Exp. to Torres Straits, v. pp. 144 sqq., and vi. pp. 100, 101. Also by Dr. Seligmann for the Melanesians of New Guinea, see passage under this heading in chap. iii. and chap. xxxvii. op. cit.">[534]</a> Others may be
reached by the study of beliefs, traditions, customs and
other forms of folk-lore. The well-known customs of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couvade</i> are one of the typical functions of the father, in
which there is an expression of a deep connection of a
magical kind between the father and his offspring. Whatever
<span class="pb" id="Pg184">[184]</span>
explanation of these customs may be given,<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor" title="Perhaps the best one is given by Dargun, loc. cit., pp. 22 sqq., where many other opinions are also quoted and criticized.">[535]</a> it cannot
be denied that they are based upon the idea of a very
intimate tie between the two individuals involved, and
that this tie is conceived as being of a mystical character.</p>

<p>There is also a series of social rules which regulate the
social position of the offspring according to that of
its parents. This group of rules might appropriately
be called <em>descent</em> in the social sense of this word.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor" title="The word descent is often used without any definition. Mr. E. S. Hartland, op. cit., i. p. 258, uses it in a sense synonymous with kinship. Mr. Thomas, too, does not define the meaning of this word, but he uses it more or less in the same way as is done in the text. Compare Thomas, loc. cit., pp. 11, 12 sqq.">[536]</a> In
the Australian societies, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> the membership of different
social groups&mdash;as the local group, the totemic clan,
the phratry, the class&mdash;is determined by the membership
of one of the parents of the given individual. And many
authors speak of tribes with paternal and maternal descent.
It must be borne in mind, nevertheless, that in order to use
the word descent in a definite sense it is always necessary
to add what social group is meant. For it is possible that
membership in the local group is determined by the father,
membership of the phratry by the mother, and membership
in the clan by neither of them. The facts of descent do
not seem to play a very important rôle and are not suitable
to be chosen as the most important feature of kinship.
The facts of inheritance also have not very much influence
upon kinship (compare below, <a href="#Pg290">pp. 290</a>, <a href="#Pg291">291</a>).</p>

<p>As it is easy to see, looking at our own ideas on parental
kinship, all the normative ideas, whether religious,
moral or legal, are in close connection with the central,
basic idea, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> in the case of our society, the idea of consanguinity.
And these normative ideas are brought by
the collective mind into causal connection with the central
idea of community of blood.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor" title="It is impossible to develop here this thought, which would require a volume if regard be had to the complexity of the fact. The references to higher societies are given by way of illustration only.">[537]</a> It would be the ideal of
<span class="pb" id="Pg185">[185]</span>
sociological research as regards our present subject if
we could bring in any given society all the normative ideas
into such a causal dependence upon the central idea, and
explain how they are conceived by the collective mind as
the outgrowth of this root idea; thus showing how all
the legal, moral and customary aspects converge on the
fundamental concept of kinship. Unhappily, in low
societies the imperfection of ethnographic material would
frustrate any attempt at such an enterprise. In Australia
our knowledge of these aspects&mdash;moral, legal and customary&mdash;is
very scanty. Although they are all undoubtedly
in quite a rudimentary state, careful investigation
would possibly disclose many points of extreme
interest.</p>

<p>One other problem must be discussed here more in
detail, owing to its great theoretical importance, viz. the
legal aspect of parental kinship. We have defined above
the meaning of the word <em>legal</em>.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor" title="See above, p. 11.">[538]</a> In connection with what
has been said, we may affirm that the <em>legal</em> is only one of
the many aspects of kinship; that legal ideas, as far as
known for any given society, must be taken into account
when defining kinship, but that the latter cannot possibly
be reduced to its legal aspect only. And it is still more
incorrect<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor" title="Comparing what we have said above on consanguinity.">[539]</a> to represent physiological consanguinity and
legal power over the child as two mutually exclusive sets
of facts beyond which there can be no determination of
parental kinship. We find the opinion expressed by many
authors, especially with regard to Australia, that where-ever
the tie binding parent and child was not constituted
by the acknowledgment of consanguinity, that there
always it was based on legal principles such as potestas,
authority, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Machtstellung</i>, or other similar ones.</p>

<p>The incorrectness of taking only these two alternatives is
shown by the three following considerations: (1) Such a
view overlooks the facts discussed below, which show that
there is actual kinship based on ideas neither physiological
<span class="pb" id="Pg186">[186]</span>
nor legal. (2) This way of interpreting facts operates
with very indeterminate concepts, for we nowhere
find any explanation of how to take the general term <em>legal</em>
in connection with a given aboriginal society, and still
less are we told how such legal concepts as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas</i>,
paternal authority, etc., are to be applied to a given
aboriginal society. (3) If a definition of <em>law</em> or <em>legal</em> be
given, it would plainly be seen that it is quite erroneous
to consider any of these concepts as defining parental
kinship. This is quite clear if we use the definition of
<em>legal</em> given above, <a href="#Pg11">p. 11</a>. But even allowing a broad
margin for the variations which may result from a varying
definition of <em>legal</em>, it may be safely stated that in whatever
way we might try to define this word, our definition must
always involve factors of social pressure, stress and authority.
In other words, the relation between two individuals
may be considered <em>legal only</em> when we imply that it is
wholly and exclusively determined by the outward regulating
control of the society and by a potential direct action
of it. And in the case we are speaking of&mdash;that is, the
relation between parent and child in low societies&mdash;there
can be hardly any question of this. As will appear in the
Australian case, this relation is left quite to itself, and it
is regulated by the spontaneous emotional attitude of
the father towards his child. No factor of any outer
pressure or constraint enters into it, at least we are not
informed of any such by the ethnographical evidence
extant. The collection and analysis of the statements on
this point given below<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor" title="pp. 238 sqq.; and pp. 254-256.">[540]</a> will show that there cannot be
any question of potestas, authority, proprietorship, or
anything of the kind. Neither social pressure nor economic
interest bind the parents to their children, nor does
any motive of this kind enter into this relation.</p>

<p>As this subject is very important, some examples of
the mode of reasoning just now criticized are set out here.
These passages are quoted from works of very distinguished
writers to show that the mistakes result from serious
<span class="pb" id="Pg187">[187]</span>
defects in sociological knowledge, and not from any accidental
causes. And they are taken from passages which
either refer exclusively to the Australian aboriginal
society, or are exemplified by Australian facts.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas, at the end of a passage in which he discusses
the relation between the concepts of kinship and
consanguinity says that in Australia "some relation will
almost certainly be found to exist between the father
and child; but it by no means follows that it arises from
any idea of consanguinity." So far we perfectly agree
with the reasoning of the author. But when Mr. Thomas
adds, "In other communities <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas</i><a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor" title="The italics are mine.">[541]</a> and not <em>consanguinity</em><a name="FNanchor_541a" id="FNanchor_541a" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor" title="The italics are mine.">[541]</a>
is held to determine the relations of the husband
of a woman to her offspring; and it is a matter for careful
inquiry how far the same holds good in Australia, when the
fact of fatherhood is in some cases asserted to be unrecognized
by the natives,"<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 5.">[542]</a> we see that he falls into the
error of acknowledging only two possibilities: potestas
or consanguinity. It is true that he speaks of consanguinity
as being modified by native ideas, and that thus
a social element is introduced into the physiological
concept of consanguinity. But we are still left to guess
how this social element is to be understood. And as
pointed out above, the relation between father and child in
the tribes in question cannot be considered as based upon
consanguinity or community of blood, whatever meaning
we give to these words. Erroneous in any case is the opposition
of kinship and potestas, as if these two concepts
were of the same order, and could be considered as two
equivalent categories excluding each other. Whereas,
as we saw, these two concepts are of quite different order
and cannot be treated as excluding or replacing each other.
Kinship is a very complicated social fact, very complex
in its sociological and psychological aspects. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Potestas</i> is a
legal category, expressing a set of attributes and rights of
the father over his children. Potestas (or any analogous
legal factor) may be a constituent element of kinship in
<span class="pb" id="Pg188">[188]</span>
certain societies. It cannot possibly replace kinship
entirely.</p>

<p>A similar unsatisfactory reasoning, it appears to me, is
to be found contained in a passage of the small but clearly
and deeply thought out work of the eminent sociologist,
the late Prof. Dargun. He stipulates as the most important
postulate of studies in family organization the
discrimination between authority and consanguinity:
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Strenges Auseinanderhalten der Gewaltverhältnisse von
den Verwandtschaftsverhältnissen."</span><a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 2.">[543]</a> And he defines
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Verwandtschaft</i> as a purely physiological fact: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"die letztere,
(Verwandtschaft) ist durch das natürliche Blutband gegeben."</span><a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[544]</a>
This is obviously an incorrect definition for
sociological use.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor" title="See above, p. 182.">[545]</a> Equally unsatisfactory is the definition
given of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gewalt</i> (potestas): <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gewalt vom natürlichen
Blutband unabhängig kann "auf sehr verschiedene historische
Wurzeln zurückführen."</span><a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 2.">[546]</a> This definition is both
negative and ambiguous, excluding elements of consanguinity
from potestas and assigning to the latter "various
historic roots." We might, therefore, expect to find everything
in this idea, but on the other hand such a definition
lacks precision and does not give either the direction in
which to look for the determining factors, or any criterion
for our recognition of the existence of personal kinship ties.
Now our definition of kinship responds to both these requirements
when applied to the Australian facts. Moreover
we find in these phrases of Dargun the alternative
condemned above between authority and consanguinity,
the latter used here in the crude physiological sense. It
may be noted that in some passages of the book in question
there are hints pointing to the fact that the author felt
the necessity of a psychological definition of paternal
kinship. So when he says, speaking of the Australians:
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Vollkommenste Vaterherrschaft, ja <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">selbst ausgesprochene
Vaterliebe</i>&mdash;gehen mit ebenso unbedingter Verwandtschaft&mdash;und
Stammeszugehörigkeit in mütterlicher Linie, Hand
<span class="pb" id="Pg189">[189]</span>
in Hand,"</span><a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 7.">[547]</a> we see that here the author speaks of
paternal love and states that this is what determines the
relation of father and child in Australia. When he speaks
afterwards of the father as: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Beschützer und Fürsorger"</span><a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[548]</a>
of his children, we see that he mentions purely
personal factors of the relation of father to child, such as
we lay stress upon in speaking of community of life and of
interests. But still the author seems to be entangled in
his alternative between consanguinity and potestas. So
we read: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Wo zwischen dem Vater und seinen Kindern
ein wirkliches Verwandtschaftsverhältniss bestehet, dort
muss auf die faktische Zeugung durch den Hausvater
entscheidendes Gewicht gelegt werden, und umgekehrt
überall wo Gleichgültigkeit gegen dieses Zeugungsverhältniss
an den Tag tritt, ist das Gewaltverhältniss des Vaters,
noch nicht zur Blutsverwandtschaft herangereift."</span><a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 8.">[549]</a> In
this phrase there is a complete oversight of the various
actual ways in which an intimate relation between father
and child may be established, and which have nothing to
do either with consanguinity or with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patria potestas</i>.</p>

<p>In the new work of Prof. Frazer there are also some
pages touching on this point. Although he distinguishes
well between the <i>physiological</i> and <i>social consanguinity</i>,<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor" title="'Fatherhood to a Central Australian savage is a very different thing from fatherhood to a civilized European. To the European father it means that he has begotten a child on a woman; to the Central Australian father it means that the child is the offspring of a woman with whom he has a right to cohabit, whether he has actually had intercourse with her or not. To the European mind the tie between a father and his child is physical; to the Central Australian it is social.'--Loc. cit., i. p. 236.">[550]</a>
still in another place he says, speaking of the Central
Tribes: "Denying as they do explicitly that the child is
begotten by the father, they can only regard him as the
consort, and in a sense as the owner of the mother, and,
therefore, as the owner of her progeny, just as a man who
owns a cow owns also the calf she brings forth. In short,
it seems probable that a man's children were viewed as
his property long before they were recognized as his offspring."
<span class="pb" id="Pg190">[190]</span>
It is impossible to agree with this opinion.
The word "property" can in no strict sense be applied
to the relation between father and child in Australia.
Besides the author does not even clearly indicate in what
sense he uses the word; and this word appears here only
as a metaphor. Moreover, it is obvious that this opinion
implies opposition between consanguinity and the legal
category of "proprietorship," and contrasts the words
"property" and "offspring."</p>

<p>In fact, as we hinted above, and as we shall have
opportunity of discussing below<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor" title="pp. 186, 254.">[551]</a> in connection with the
evidence, there is little ground for speaking of <i>authority</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patria potestas</i>, "<em>ownership</em>" or any similar attributes of
the father as regards his children in Australia. It must
not be forgotten that these words are nearly meaningless
as long as they have not a legal sense. According to the
definition of <em>legal</em> we should say that two people stand to
each other in a purely legal relation when certain norms
are laid down and actively sanctioned by society, which requires
a definite mutual behaviour and attitude on the part
of each. It was pointed out above that in Australia we
have data allowing us to speak of the legal aspect of social
institutions and relations;<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor" title="p. 11 sqq.">[552]</a> it appears improbable, though,
that there could be found any <em>purely</em> legal relation. At
any rate, nothing of that sort determines or forms the substance
of the relation between father and child in Australia.
If a father should kill or abandon his child, he would, for
all we know, be left quite undisturbed. Nobody compels
him to provide for its subsistence, to protect it and care
for it.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor" title="In our society, if parents wish to abandon their progeny while still dependent, they would be prevented by the law from doing it, and compelled to perform a series of duties and services, which usually spring from the natural parental love. Thus we see that in our society the relation between parents and children has much more of a legal character than in Australia. Nevertheless it would seem quite absurd to style this relation in our society as essentially a legal one. ...">[553]</a> There are spontaneous elements that bind him
<span class="pb" id="Pg191">[191]</span>
to it. And these spontaneous elements (to discover them
will be our task) determine his relation to his child.
Undoubtedly this kinship relation presents <em>some</em> legal
features, such as, for instance, his right to dispose of his
daughter in marriage (a right which in some tribes is
reported to belong to the mother or mother's brother).
But we know very little about it.<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor" title="Compare pp. 254 sqq.">[554]</a> At any rate, there are
only a few occasions on which the relation in question
involves any possibility of social intervention.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor" title="The legal norms are an essential object of study also from the standpoint that they may be the expression of some important ideas held about kinship. Especially the motivation of these norms, as given by the aborigines, may be of high value in this respect. But obviously this does not mean that kinship is a legal category.">[555]</a></p>

<p>Nobody ever doubts, as far as I can see, the fact that
all personal ties between two individuals consist not only
of ideas, but also of feelings, and that they are influenced
no less by the feelings the two individuals mutually inspire
than by the ideas they form of each other. To
ascertain, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i>, if there be friendship between two people,
one seeks to know their feelings towards each other, as
well as what they think about each other. The relation
between a parent and a child is in our society chiefly
determined by their mutual feelings. And in a case
where these feelings are absent, this relationship&mdash;in spite
of all legal, moral, and other factors which tend to maintain
its form&mdash;is deeply affected. It may be taken for
granted that the sentimental side most essentially determines
in a given society any kind of personal relationship.
And in the same society the character of a given personal
relation&mdash;be it parental kinship or anything else&mdash;varies
with the intensity of the feeling and is essentially defined
by the latter. It may be accepted also, that in different
societies the types of feelings corresponding to given
personal relations may vary according to the society, and
<span class="pb" id="Pg192">[192]</span>
may define in each one this given relation in its most
essential character. In other words, the concept of
collective feelings can be applied as well as the concept
of collective ideas.<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor" title="As is well known, we are indebted for the concept of collective ideas to the French school of Prof. Durkheim and his associates. Throughout this study, and especially in this chapter, I have done my best to avail myself of this valuable methodological standpoint.">[556]</a> By this is to be understood certain
types of feeling, which being dependent on corresponding
collective ideas possess the same essential character as the
latter: they exist in a certain society, and are transmitted
from generation to generation; they impose themselves
on the individual mind, and possess the character
of necessity; they are deeply connected with certain
social institutions; in fact they stand to them in the
relation of functional dependence (in the mathematical
sense). So, for instance, it is clear that in the hypothetical
primitive promiscuous society, in which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex hypothesi</i>
there would be no individual relationship, the feelings
of affection for the individual offspring could not exist.
We could only speak of the "collective feeling" of
<em>group affection</em>. So it seems to me that the relation of
parents to children cannot be treated with any approach
to completeness without seriously taking into account
its emotional character.</p>

<p>But even if the foremost importance of emotional
elements and the possibility of treating them as collective
feelings were granted, there is another objection to be
met. Granted that these elements are actually quite
essential in determining family relations, it might be
objected that they are too shapeless and indeterminate
in themselves to be of any practical use in
scientific research, especially if our theories have to be
based upon ethnographic observations in which the
more tangible and the more unambiguous the facts chosen,
the less the risk of being misled. Now, are not feelings
of the most indeterminate character, the most misleading,
and the most difficult to ascertain? In fact, the theory
<span class="pb" id="Pg193">[193]</span>
of feelings and emotions seems to be the least developed
in individual as well as in social psychology. Especially
it might be suggested that to pursue the investigation on
double lines is useless; feelings always find adequate
expression in ideas, in fact crystallize in them.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor" title="It seems needless to add that the deep connection and mutual dependence of both feelings and ideas is perfectly acknowledged. This is not the place, of course, to pursue any detailed psychological investigations. I would like to remind the reader that all that is said here must be judged by its application to the Australian facts given below. In higher societies where art, poetry and thought lend themselves much more to the expression of feelings, the former afford objective documents of the latter. ...">[557]</a> Without
trying to give a general answer to these objections,
they may be met as regards the special case under discussion.
In Australia, as a matter of fact, they do not
hold good. For our knowledge of the sentimental side
of parental kinship is much better and much more determinate
than our knowledge of any other aspect of this
relation.</p>

<p>It may be here indicated why our knowledge on this
point may be considered as a well-founded one. As stated
below (<a href="#Pg249">pp. 249</a>, <a href="#Pg250">250</a>) the agreement between the statements
as to parental feelings is quite an exceptional one.
Comparing it with the usual discrepancy between the
reports of different observers on many other points, which
would appear much less liable to any subjectivity, this
complete agreement and the relative exactness of our
information is highly remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor" title="Compare below, p. 250.">[558]</a> It should be noted
that on this point there is no extrinsic reason, or secondary
motive, that would make us suspect an artificial cause
of agreement. The point in question forms no part of
any theory; it affects no moral or racial susceptibilities.
And there was no special reason why so many observers
should pay attention to it, and why they all should state
the same thing: viz. extreme love and fondness towards
the children on the part of the parents. This agreement
<span class="pb" id="Pg194">[194]</span>
shows that the facts which the ethnographers had under
observation were so expressive of the underlying psychology,
and they struck the writers so strongly that they
simply felt compelled to notice them. And observing
closely the facts through which those feelings of paternal
affection found their expression, it becomes evident that
these feelings are not so indeterminate as might <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>
be supposed; that, on the contrary, they find quite an
unequivocal expression in a series of facts. Let us look
more closely at these facts.</p>

<p>In the first place consider the facts of daily life<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor" title="Conys. Statements, pp. 238 sqq.">[559]</a>&mdash;the
behaviour of parents towards children in all the cases
where the latter want help or merit punishment. We
read that on all such occasions both parents exhibit
great kindness and extreme leniency. The children are
carefully looked after by the father as well as by the
mother; and they are very seldom punished. In one
place it is even stated that the father is more lenient than
the mother. Now is it not in agreement with all our every-day
experiences that in such facts and features of daily
life prominent and characteristic feelings find their
adequate expression? And is the accordance of opinion
among all our Australian informants on this point
not a proof that they were able to judge with great certainty
from these facts concerning the underlying feelings?&mdash;that
these outer signs were unmistakable expressions
of the inner facts? Undoubtedly our information
is too little detailed, and particulars referring to treatment
of children and other features of the aboriginal
daily life in this connection would be of the highest value.
But considering that the attention of the observers was
never specially drawn to these questions by any theoretical
writer, and comparing our information on this point
with other parts of our evidence, it must be acknowledged
that it is exceptionally good. And this reliability is doubtless
in the first place due to the fact that the subject of
observation was clear, unambiguous and well determined.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg195">[195]</span>
We are, moreover, in possession of a few reports of
actual occurrences in which the great love displayed
by the parents for their children is shown in its full
strength and under the stress of special circumstances. In
a battle that took place between some aborigines and
settlers, the former were put to flight. They had to
cross a river, but in doing so they left a child behind
them. It was seized by a Maori who was at the station,
and it was shown to the blacks standing on the other
bank of the river. The father of the child recognized
it at once. He seemed almost frantic, held out his arms
eagerly towards the child, making at the same time signs
for it to be given to him. The Maori pretended to be
willing to give it and made signs to the black to cross the
river again. And the black swam across the river to
rescue his child. Thus he did not hesitate to risk his
life in order to save his child; in the end he was treacherously
murdered by the Maori.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor" title="Br. Smyth, ii. p. 311.">[560]</a> Another touching story
is told by Rob. Dawson concerning a mother's grief
after the loss of her son. He says that the woman was
utterly transformed by the blow. "Before the catastrophe
she was a remarkably fine woman, being tall and
athletic beyond any other in the settlement; <em>now</em>, she
was a truly wretched and forlorn spectacle, apparently
wasted down by watching and sorrow. I have seen
this poor creature often since our first meeting, at their
different camps near us, and she has still the same
wretched appearance."<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 92, 93.">[561]</a> These tales show that parental
feelings could be as deep and pathetic among the
Australian blacks as in any cultured society. We read
another story in Howitt,<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., p. 189.">[562]</a> who tells us that when he
was living one day in his camp in the Dieri country the
father of a lad, who was visiting Howitt's camp the day
before, came in a state of utmost alarm and terror. The
lad, his son, was missing, and they could not find
him. The father was terrified and, suspecting that the
<span class="pb" id="Pg196">[196]</span>
white men had concealed the lad and might carry him
away, he looked through Howitt's luggage. It may be
noted that this occurred among the Dieri, where it is
said that individual paternity does not obtain. Nevertheless
it was not a group of fathers that came worrying
and striving to find the boy; neither was it a group of
fathers that risked their lives for the child, nor a group
of mothers that was grieving to death for their child.
In the few anecdotes reported below with the other statements
we see also how strongly paternal affection is
marked. So in the story of the old man quite infatuated
with his son and disconsolate after his death, and in the
story of another man eager to rescue his boy, and the
old man in Curr's story, who allowed his boy to do
anything he liked.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor" title="Compare pp. 248, 249; and 269 sqq.">[563]</a></p>

<p>Such stories and anecdotes could be easily multiplied
from the ethnographical material extant. They all corroborate
our proposition, viz. that the sentimental side
of the parental relation expresses itself quite clearly
and tangibly in ever so many facts of different order,
and that it would be easy for a well-informed observer
to give a fairly exact account of the feelings in terms of
facts. These facts, as said above, are in the first place
the facts of daily life, which are quite unmistakable in
their meaning and easily expressed in an accurate manner.
The proof of it is that we have now relatively abundant
data, although no methodical research was devoted to
these facts. Then there are different occasions on which
the limit of affection, the maximum and minimum of
their range in a given society, is established. Such are
the foregoing stories. I think we can safely conclude that
the emotional side is on the one hand quite essential,
and important enough to take the first place in our considerations.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor" title="The importance of the emotional character of parental kinship has already been theoretically studied. Prof. K. Buecher (loc. cit., p. 19) represents the primitive parents as selfish, heartless, with no love or attachment for the child, and draws important conclusions from this. Dr. Steinmetz has subjected this assumption to a thorough criticism; taking his stand on a rich collection of ethnological data, he shows that this assumption is without any ground; ...">[564]</a>
On the other hand it can be accurately
<span class="pb" id="Pg197">[197]</span>
described in terms of objective data for the purpose
of being chosen as the chief characteristic of the parental
relation. It must be added that not a single other side
or aspect of this relation appears to fulfil these conditions
in the same degree. As will subsequently appear, our
knowledge about the aboriginal <em>ideas</em> on parental relationship
are not so ample by far as our knowledge about
their <em>feelings</em> in that connection.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion has been mainly concerned
with the collective ideas which define parental kinship,
and the different sets of social facts in which these ideas
find their expression have been enumerated. It also
dealt with collective feelings, and the different facts in
which these are to be looked for were surveyed. We
must now emphasize the fact that just as we may say
that the different ideas determining kinship converge
towards one central concept, or rather flow out of one
common central idea of kinship, so there is also an intimate
connection between the ideas determining kinship
and the feelings bound up with it. This becomes obvious
if our own social conditions be considered. As mentioned
above, a father in our society loves his child in a great
measure because he knows that it is his own offspring.
In societies in which the idea of consanguinity (in the
social sense) does not exist, such a connection between
feelings of paternal love and knowledge of a physiological
procreation would be impossible. And it would be of
the highest sociological interest to trace what form such
connections assume. An attempt at such a study would
be possible in our own society and in other higher
<span class="pb" id="Pg198">[198]</span>
societies, although there would be serious difficulties
enough. But there would hardly be sufficient material to
attempt it in any lower society, and there is absolutely
no possibility of doing this for Australia.</p>

<p>A brief summary of the foregoing argument may now
be given. It was stated at the beginning that parental
kinship corresponds to a very complex and manifold
set of phenomena; moreover in various societies this
relationship is determined by various elements. The
problem is to find in all this complexity the structural
features, the really essential facts, the knowledge of which
in any given society would enable us to give a scientifically
valid description of kinship. In other words, the
problem is to give a general formula defining kinship,
which would state its constant elements and give heed
to the essential varying elements therein; that formula
being on the one hand not too narrow for application
to the various human societies, it would be on the
other hand not too vague to afford quite definite
results when applied to any special case. A final solution
of this problem cannot be arrived at <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>, but
only by way of induction, after the facts in the different
human societies have been studied. And in order to
attempt such a preliminary study of the Australian facts,
the foregoing remarks have been given; they aim at a
general definition of the kind just described in the form
of a tentative or preliminary sketch. Consequently in
the first place the attempt was made to ascertain what
could be taken as the constant elements in individual
parental kinship. What appeared to be nearly universal
in this connection is the fact that infants and small
children are always specially attached, and stand in a
specific close relation to a man and a woman.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor" title="Compare the footnote above, p. 174.">[565]</a> The
woman is invariably their own mother, who gave them
birth; the man is the woman's husband. The existence of
this group, which may be called the individual family,
is the basis upon which kinship may be determined; it is
<span class="pb" id="Pg199">[199]</span>
the condition under which it is possible to speak of
individual parental kinship in any given society.</p>

<p>But it was shown that the knowledge of these facts is
not sufficient to yield a precise idea of maternal and paternal
kinship, and that many of its manifold aspects of
foremost sociological interest would remain unknown
if the inquiry were broken off at this point. These latter
aspects depend upon factors which are by no means
constant in all societies, but have a very wide range of
variation depending on the general social conditions. A
discussion of the concept of consanguinity has shown
that the variations go so far as to affect the main question
of paternal kinship: "Who is the father (in the social
sense) of a child, and how is he determined?"</p>

<p>In order to indicate in which direction the varying
general conditions of society must be investigated so as
to yield all that is essential for the sociological knowledge
of kinship, it was found most convenient to range the
facts in two main lines of inquiry: (1) The different
sets of facts which express the central collective idea
of what fatherhood is; and the various other collective
ideas&mdash;legal, customary, moral&mdash;of a normative character
referring to the relation in question. The social facts in
which these ideas must be looked for are: Beliefs, traditions,
customs referring to the relation in question (as for
instance the couvade type), and functions of kindred
such as legal duties and obligations between parent and
child. (2) The facts in which the expression of the
collective feelings characteristic of the relation in question
is to be found. The facts of daily life, as well as the
dramatic expression of feelings, come in here. The emotional
character of the parental kinship relation is of
the highest importance in determining the social feature
of this relation, and for the comprehension of its social
working.</p>

<p>These points of view will be applied hereafter to the
discussion of the Australian parental kinship. But in
order to illustrate here their theoretical bearing, a short
<span class="pb" id="Pg200">[200]</span>
discussion will be given of some of the ways in which the
concept of kinship has been applied to low societies by
sociologists. Morgan's way of dealing with the meaning
of kinship must be first mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor" title="Compare also above, p. 171.">[566]</a> He assumes
without further discussion that kinship was conceived
always and in all societies, even the lowest ones, in terms
of consanguinity.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor" title="Compare especially Systems, etc., chap. ii. pp. 10 sqq. 'The family relationships are as ancient as the family. They exist in virtue of the law of derivation, which is expressed by the perpetuation of the species through the marriage relations. A system of consanguinity, which is founded upon a community of blood, is but the formal expression and recognition of these relationships.' (The italics are mine.) ...">[567]</a> Our discussion of consanguinity shows
how great a mistake it was on the part of Morgan
to impute to the primitive mind a whole series of ideas
which absolutely and necessarily must have been foreign
to it. As was said above, primitive mankind was certainly
wholly ignorant of the process of procreation, and
the relation of the sexes cannot possibly have been the
source of kinship ideas. How great a part this assumption
plays in Morgan's deductions it is easy to perceive.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor" title="Systems, etc., pp. 474 sqq., where the only source of the classificatory system is attributed to different 'customs' referring to the sexual aspect of marriage. As we saw, precisely this aspect is quite irrelevant to the formation of primitive kinship ideas, consequently also of primitive kinship terms.">[568]</a>
And he was led to it by omitting to discuss and analyze
the concept of kinship, and by applying to low societies
our own social concept of it.</p>

<p>J. F. MacLennan uses also the kinship concept as
identical with that of blood relationship.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor" title="See loc. cit., pp. 83 sqq. It is difficult to pick out any one clear statement to show that the author identifies kinship with consanguinity. But a glance at the pages quoted is enough to prove this. I quote a phrase from the table of contents: 'The most ancient system in which the idea of blood relationship was embodied was a system of kinship through females only.' (The italics are mine.)">[569]</a> But it must
be emphatically stated that MacLennan recognizes both
<span class="pb" id="Pg201">[201]</span>
the importance of feelings in relation to kinship<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor" title="Men are always 'bound together by a feeling of kindred. The filial and paternal affections may be instinctive. They are obviously independent of any theory of kinship, its origin and consequences ... they may have existed long before kinship became an object of thought,' op. cit., p. 83. From these remarks it is only one step to say that feelings ought to be considered as determining elements, and that even if ideas corresponding to them did not exist, kinship could not be denied.">[570]</a> and
the fact that consanguinity was not known to primitive
man,<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor" title="No advocate of innate ideas will maintain their existence on relationship by blood,' op. cit., p. 83.">[571]</a> although he unfortunately does not develop these
two important ideas.</p>

<p>The same use of the concept of kinship (Verwandtschaft)
was pointed out above as a mistake of Dargun's.
The ideas on kinship of Prof. Frazer and Mr. Thomas
were also dealt with above, where it was found that they
were not adapted to the complexity of the facts.</p>

<p>Mr. Sidney Hartland rightly sees that kinship is not
necessarily identical with consanguinity in our sense.
But he wrongly restricts kinship to a specific kind of ideas
about community of blood. "Though kinship, however, is
not equivalent to blood relationship in our sense of the
term, it is founded on the idea of common blood which
all within the kin possess, and to which all outside the
kin are strangers. A feeling of solidarity runs through
the entire kin, so that it may be said without hyperbole
that the kin is regarded as one entire life, one body
whereof each unit is more than metaphorically a member,
a limb. The same blood runs through them all, and
'the blood is the life.'"<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor" title="Primitive Paternity, i. pp. 257-258.">[572]</a> This definition, illustrated
as it is by many examples, is one more instance showing
that the idea underlying kinship may be different from
the idea of consanguinity in our sense, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> consanguinity
of blood through procreation. But the affirmation
that kinship is always based on some idea of common
blood, seems to be not in accord with the facts. Moreover
this passage, which is the only one designed to define
kinship, is quite inadequate to the importance of the
<span class="pb" id="Pg202">[202]</span>
subject, especially in a treatise devoted to primitive
paternity, and the result is that in this admirable work
the purely sociological side presents some obscurities.
The following remark: "Kindred with the father is
first and foremost <ins id="C202" title="judical">juridical</ins>&mdash;a social convention"<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor" title="Sidney Hartland, ii. p. 99.">[573]</a> is
also incorrect in the light of the foregoing discussion of
the legal aspect of kinship.</p>

<p>Dr. Rivers defines: "Kin and Kinship.&mdash;These terms
should be limited to the relationship ... which can
be demonstrated genealogically." This is quite a
formalistic definition and does not at all meet the
full facts of the case. Moreover it seems that in
this way we define the unknown by what is still more
indeterminate. For to draw up a genealogy we must
first know who are the individuals between whom the
line of descent is to be drawn; in other words we must
know how fatherhood is defined in a given society.
Among the Todas, Dr. Rivers had to ascertain in what
way the father of a given child is determined, before he
could proceed to draw up the genealogies.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor" title="Of course I insist here only upon the logical and methodological priority of the psychological determination of kinship over the genealogical. In reality, wherever individual paternal kinship exists, the genealogies may be drawn first, and they possess an independent value, even if we did not know what is the content of the aboriginal idea of kinship. ...">[574]</a> In any case
the problem of kinship requires in the actual state of
<span class="pb" id="Pg203">[203]</span>
things not only a purely formal definition, but a detailed
analysis. Much more important as regards the present
problem is the way in which Dr. Rivers has described
the kinship of the Torres Straits Islanders.<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor" title="Camb. Univ. Exp., v. chap. iii. on Kinship, pp. 129 sqq. In particular, pp. 142-152, under the headings 'The Functions of certain Kin,' and 'Kinship Taboos.'">[575]</a> In introducing
the study of the functions of kin he points
to a series of important facts which determine some
social aspect of kinship and afford an insight into some
of the collective ideas concerning this relation. It must
be borne in mind, however, that the set of functions
described by Dr. Rivers gives us only a partial knowledge
of the social aspect of kinship. The every-day functions
corresponding to treatment, behaviour, feeding and so
forth, which characterize the intimate or home aspect of
the kinship relation, ought not to be omitted. They correspond,
according to our analysis, to feelings which make
an essential part of the relation in question. The social
functions of kin collected by Dr. Rivers, expressing certain
duties and privileges of the kinsmen involved, correspond
to certain customary norms. A complete collection
of all legal norms and all moral rules would be an essential
addition. That such moral rules do exist among the
Torres Straits Islanders appears certain from the precepts
given at initiation to youths.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor" title="Recorded by Dr. Haddon, loc. cit., v. p. 210.">[576]</a></p>

<p>Messrs. Fison and Howitt in their treatise on Australian
kinship<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn.">[577]</a> do not give anywhere a clear definition of the
concept in question. The only place where something like
definition is given is page 121, where kinship is said to be
"membership in the same tribal division," and where there
is an acknowledgment that beyond "kinship" there still
lies "personal relationship" between the parent and
child. This is true, but this is only the first distinction
upon which the actual discussion of the problem ought
to be based. That the want of such a discussion is a
serious defect in the book is obvious.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg204">[204]</span>
The important distinction between kinship (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parenté</i>)
and consanguinity, which is one of the chief results of the
foregoing pages, has been made already by Prof. Durkheim.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor" title="A.S., i. p. 316.">[578]</a>
Nevertheless the exclusive stress that M. Durkheim
lays upon the legal aspect of kinship would not
seem adapted to the complexity of the facts. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"La
parenté est essentiellement constitué par des obligations
juridiques et morales que la société impose à certains
individus."</span> This is not enough. There are certain ideas
which affirm a strong bond between parent and child,
and undoubtedly these ideas, although neither of legal
nor moral character, exercise a strong influence on the
relation in question. Possibly the difference could be
reduced to the broader sense in which Prof. Durkheim
uses the words <em>legal</em> and <em>moral</em>; as his remarks are
necessarily short, being contained in a review, it is difficult
exactly to ascertain their sense. We have tried to show
that, especially in reference to low societies, both these
terms must be used with caution, and that a definite sense
must be given to them. Besides, I do not share Prof.
Durkheim's view that by substituting the word "kinship"
for the word "consanguinity" all Morgan's deductions
could be rectified.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 318.">[579]</a> The constitution of the family is
something quite different from and much more complicated
than the sexual aspect of marriage, and it cannot
be at once seen whether the nomenclature of kinship
(systems of kinship terms) could be shown to be rooted
in the former with the same ease as it can be shown in
the latter case. This would require a special study.</p>

<p>M. A. van Gennep also clearly establishes the distinction
between <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parenté sociale</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parenté physique</i>.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. lxiii. (of the Introduction).">[580]</a>
According to our terminology the latter would correspond
to physiological consanguinity, while the former would be
identical with what we called parental kinship. We see
that this distinction is quite in agreement with our
theory. Only we called social consanguinity a special
<span class="pb" id="Pg205">[205]</span>
case of kinship, where the collective ideas on procreation
play the essential rôle. Obviously these ideas may be
more or less physiologically correct or erroneous. But
where they are completely absent (as in Australia) we
prefer not to use the suggestive term <em>consanguinity</em>, and
to distinguish these cases from the former we use the
term <em>kinship</em>. M. A. van Gennep remarks further that the
Central Australians do not know the real cause of procreation
in spite of some illusory appearances (we shall
deal with this question in detail below and solve it quite
in agreement with the author in question); he shows the
wide extension of this negative belief in the Australian
continent, and speaking of the South Australian tribes,
points out that the most important aspect is that they
prove the independence of kinship and consanguinity.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor" title="'L'indépendance réciproque du point de vue biologique et du point de vue social chez les Australiens.' (Ibid., p. lxv.)">[581]</a></p>

<p>The same distinction between consanguinity and kinship
is also made by Prof. Westermarck in his discussion of the
classificatory system of relationship, and Prof. Westermarck
has already brought the important objection
against Morgan, viz. that the latter has "given no
evidence for the truth of his assumption that the classificatory
system" is a system of blood ties,<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor" title="H.H.M., p. 89.">[582]</a> an objection
which has appeared also to us as fundamental. Unfortunately,
Prof. Westermarck has not given any
exhaustive discussion of the concept of kinship.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish to mention a passage by Sir Laurence
Gomme, which contains suggestive remarks nearly
identical with some views set forth in this chapter. "It
is of no use translating a native term as 'father,' if father
did not mean to the savage what it means to us. It
might mean something so very different. With us fatherhood
connotes a definite individual with all sorts of social,
economical and political associations, but what does it
mean to the savage? It may mean physical fatherhood
and nothing more, and physical fatherhood may be a fact
<span class="pb" id="Pg206">[206]</span>
of the veriest insignificance. It may mean social fatherhood
... and thus becomes" (in some cases), "much
more than we can understand by the term father."<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 232, 233; compare also above p. 182, footnote. Apart from the naturally somewhat loose terminology (the passage about kinship is intended as an example only, and does not aim at a full treatment of the subject)--the passages quoted express the same ideas which served as a starting-point for this chapter . ...">[583]</a></p>

<p>It may also be pointed out for the sake of completeness
that in the great majority of human societies parental
kinship assumes the form of consanguinity; the ideas that
underlie kinship are generally gathered round the facts
of procreation. These facts are connected with such deep
and powerful instincts and feelings that in the majority
of cases they naturally shape and influence the ideas of
maternity and paternity. But the few exceptions to
this rule which we meet with in very primitive societies
are of the highest theoretical interest, both from the
evolutionist's and psychologist's point of view. The final
remark I would like to make here is on the well-known
fact that physiological maternity is much more easily
<span class="pb" id="Pg207">[207]</span>
ascertainable than physiological paternity. Paternal
kinship, therefore, will much more frequently differ from
what we called consanguinity than maternal kinship.
But some of the Australian examples and our previous
general considerations should make us cautious in laying
down <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> any assertion of the purely physiological
character of maternity.</p>

<h3>II<br />
<small><span class="smcap">Some Examples of Kinship Ideas suggested by the
Australian Folk-lore</span></small></h3>

<p>The foregoing remarks on kinship, and the sketch of a
general definition of kinship given above, of course bear
upon the whole of the present investigations, since
parental kinship being one of the relationships involved
in the individual family, all that refers to this latter unit
relates more or less immediately to parental kinship.
In the other chapters we attempt to discuss the existence
of the individual family, and of those of its features which
appear to be universal, and which have, therefore, been
adopted as the basis of parental kinship. The general
features of the Australian individual family are given in
the concluding chapter, and a comparison of the results
presented there with the foregoing general definition of
kinship<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor" title="pp. 198 sqq.">[584]</a> will be sufficient to satisfy the first point of this
definition, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> to prove the existence of individual
parental kinship in Australia and to describe its constant
elements. In the following chapter (<a href="#Pg234">Chap. VII.</a>) attention
will be paid to the functions of kin, which correspond to
the collective feelings of parents to children. Here we
shall discuss the data taken from Australian folk-lore,
which bear upon the parental kinship, and shall thus
satisfy that part of our definition in which it was laid down
that the ideas of kinship must be investigated.</p>

<p>The survey may commence with the Central tribes,
<span class="pb" id="Pg208">[208]</span>
the folk-lore of which we know best, owing to the excellent
information given by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, subsequently
confirmed in its main lines by the joint publication
of Herr Strehlow and Frhr. von Leonhardi. In these works
we possess a very detailed description of the aboriginal
views on conception and birth, which are connected with
their totemic beliefs. These views will not be reproduced
here <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i>, and the reader is referred to the
sources and the special works.<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor" title="Here in the first place must be mentioned the works of Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., pp. 123-127, 255; Nor. Tr., pp. 144, 163 sqq., 169 sqq., 174-176, 150, 330, 331; Mrs. Parker, pp. 50 sqq., 61, 98. ...">[585]</a> The reader is therefore,
<span class="pb" id="Pg209">[209]</span>
supposed to be acquainted with the aboriginal views on
conception, and only the ideas which in these theories
refer directly to our subject, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> those underlying
parental kinship, will be dealt with here.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking it may be said that these totemic
beliefs and theories of conception prevent the aboriginal
mind from forming the idea of physiological paternity
and even probably weaken the social importance of
maternity. For the only cause of pregnancy is that a
"spirit-child" entered the body of a woman. "The
natives one and all in these tribes believe that the child is
the direct result of the entrance into the mother of an
ancestral spirit individual. They have no idea of procreation
as being directly associated with sexual intercourse,
and firmly believe that children can be born
without this taking place. There are, for example, in
the Arunta country certain stones which are supposed
to be charged with spirit children, who can, by magic,
be made to enter the bodies of women, or will do so on
their own accord."<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor" title="This refers to the whole Central and North Central area. Spencer and Gillen, Nor. Tr., p. 330. In a short note of recent date (Athenæum, Nov. 4, 1911, p. 562), we read that Prof. B. Spencer has found the same absence of physiological knowledge in the tribes living North-West of the 'Northern Tribes' (from Roper River to Port Darwin). According to his opinion this belief obtains from the South Coast of Australia over a broad belt right through the Centre to the North Coast. (Ibid.)">[586]</a> Accordingly no tie of blood can be
supposed to exist between the father and his child; there
is no room for any ideas of physiological paternity; in
other words, using our terminology, social consanguinity
between father and child does not exist.<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor" title="It may be remembered here that this is not in contradiction with the passage in M. A. von Gennep's work, Mythes and Légendes d'Australie, p. lxiii, implying that there is social but not physiological consanguinity between father and child in the Central Australian tribes. The difference in terminology is explained above, p. 178, footnote 1, and reasons are given explaining why I did not adopt M. A. von Gennep's terminology, although I completely share his views.">[587]</a> This is the
<span class="pb" id="Pg210">[210]</span>
most general conclusion that can be drawn from the
beliefs quoted. But in connection with this question
there are still some details, some controversial points into
which we must enter in order to dissipate any doubts as
to the correctness of our general conclusions just mentioned,
as well as of some subsequent reasonings.</p>

<p>(1) There seems to be some incertitude as to the complete
absence among the natives of any knowledge regarding
the physiology of procreation. We read in Strehlow,<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., ii. p. 52, footnote 7.">[588]</a>
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"<ins id="C210" title="Ubrigens">Übrigens</ins> wissen die alten Männer, wie mir versichert
wurde, dass die cohabitatio als Grund der Kinderkonzeption
anzusehen sei, sagen aber davon den jüngeren
Männern und Frauen nichts."</span> This phrase might evoke
some doubts as to whether we should attribute so much
importance to the alleged ignorance.<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor" title="Attention was drawn to this phrase by P. W. Schmidt in his article in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie (1908), p. 866 sqq., where the theory of conception among the Arunta is discussed. He doubts: 'Ob wirklich eine vollständige Unkenntniss des Zusammenhanges von Koitus und Konzeption in primitivem Zustande vorhanden ist.'--Loc. cit., p. 883.">[589]</a> But according to
subsequent information in the same publication,<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor" title="Strehlow, iii. pp. x., xi.">[590]</a> we
must not attach to this phrase too much weight. Possibly
the knowledge of the old men comes from alien sources;
at any rate we see from the explanation given below by
Frhr. von Leonhardi that this phrase does not rest on any
concrete facts, or any well-founded information. From
the point of view of collective ideas it must always be
remembered that it is in the social institutions of a given
people and in the whole of their beliefs that we must look
for the foundation and confirmation of a given creed. It
would be a superfluous digression to point out how deeply
the totemic theory of conception is connected with all the
other beliefs and the whole social life of the Australian
aborigines&mdash;as this has been done by so many students
<span class="pb" id="Pg211">[211]</span>
of the subject, and pre-eminently by Prof. Frazer in his
recent work on <cite>Totemism and Exogamy</cite>. Some doubts
might also arise from the fact that the natives apparently
know the real process of propagation in the case of the
animals. There is undoubtedly some difficulty here;
and additional information on this point would be most
valuable. Nevertheless the case is not quite hopeless:
if we assume that this correct physiological knowledge is
of a relatively late origin, it is quite natural that it would
arise first in relation to the animal world, because the
ideas about man, being the most important and elaborate,
would be the most conservative. Anyhow this point
requires further elucidation.<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor" title="Frhr. von Reitzenstein shares the view here accepted; comp. his review of Mr. Hartland's 'Primitive Paternity' in Zeitschr. f. Ethnologie, 43 Jhg. (1911), p. 175.">[591]</a></p>

<p>(2) We must insist upon another point, which might at
first sight cast some shadow of suspicion even on the
foregoing one. We read in Spencer and Gillen<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 265.">[592]</a> that
sexual intercourse "prepares the mother for the reception
and birth also of an already formed spirit-child who
inhabits one of the local totem centres." And this belief
of "preparation," although at first denied by Strehlow,<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., ii. p. 52, footnote 7.">[593]</a>
was substantiated by him after a more careful investigation
and emphatically affirmed.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., iii. p. xi.">[594]</a> Although there might
seem to be at first sight some room for doubt, whether
this belief does not create some connection between
copulation and pregnancy, and so a bridge for the formation
of ideas of paternity, a moment's reflection dissipates
these doubts. For in this belief there is absolutely
nothing that would point to any <em>individual</em> male as the
father of the child. We do not know whether, according
to the native beliefs, there must be this preparation for
each incarnation, or whether it means only that a female
cannot conceive without being deflorated. Considering
the emphasis with which, according to Spencer and Gillen,
<span class="pb" id="Pg212">[212]</span>
the natives deny any causal connection between copulation
and birth, the second supposition seems to be the
more probable. But even if the first supposition were the
right one, it does not imply any knowledge that a given
man has contributed to the body or soul of the child.
The latter, already formed (although diminutive in form)
enters the womb of a woman. We see therefore that
our general conclusion of <a href="#Pg209">page 209</a> is by no means
contradicted by this detail in the aboriginal beliefs.</p>

<p>(3) In the third place I would like to deal with the
question whether the totemic beliefs concerning conception
contain the idea of any reincarnation of ancestors,
as this point will be subsequently of importance to us.
And on this important question there is controversy too.
Spencer and Gillen emphatically state: "In the whole of
this wide area, the belief that every living member of the
tribe is the reincarnation of a spirit ancestor is universal.
This belief is just as firmly held by the Urabunna people,
who count descent in the female line, as in the Arunta
and Warramunga, who count descent in the male line."<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. xi. Compare also pp. 145, 606. Spencer and Gillen's statement is corroborated by various other independent authors, some of them being even critically disposed. The reincarnation of ancestors is asserted by the missionaries Teichelmann and Schürmann, in reference to the Adelaide tribe (compare below, p. 217, note 4). Mr. Thomas has shown (Man, 1904, § 68, pp. 99, 100) that the belief in reincarnation is implied in the Rev. L. Schultze's statement. ...">[595]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the belief in reincarnation is expressly
and explicitly denied by Strehlow and Leonhardi:
<span class="pb" id="Pg213">[213]</span>
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Den Glauben an eine immer wiederkehrende
Reincarnation dieses altjirangamitjina (= alcheringa of
Spencer and Gillen), den Spencer and Gillen gefunden
haben wollen, hat Herr Strehlow nicht feststellen können."</span><a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor" title="Bn. Leonhardi in Strehlow, i. Introduction (third page; there is no pagination).">[596]</a>
In another passage of the same work the
expression of Spencer and Gillen, "in every tribe without
exception there exists a firm belief in the reincarnation
of ancestors," is simply designated as misleading ("irreführend")
by the editor (Frhr. v. Leonhardi).<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor" title="Strehlow, ii. p. 57, end of the long footnote.">[597]</a></p>

<p>We seem here to be again at a loss. For behind the
mere assertions of both parties there is a considerable
amount of fact which seems to corroborate each of them.
Spencer and Gillen do not give us bare statements. Such
concrete and detailed accounts of beliefs as those quoted
below<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor" title="Compare p. 216.">[598]</a> are very cogent. We see by them that Spencer
and Gillen's assertion concerning the existence of reincarnation
is the general expression of a series of positive
facts; as there cannot be any doubt as to the authenticity
of the latter, the general assertion of our authors is convincing!
But if we inquire more precisely into the
nature of this reincarnation we find certain "contradictions"
and "inconsistencies" in these beliefs, and we can
quite safely agree with Frhr. von Leonhardi that if we
"take the expression exactly to the letter"<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., ii. p. 56.">[599]</a> we are
compelled to deny the existence of any ideas of reincarnation.
The only objection is that any attempt
to give "strict" or "exact" sense to aboriginal ideas is
completely misplaced. The aborigines are not able to
think exactly, and their beliefs do not possess any "exact
meaning." And if an attempt be made to interpret them
in this way, we shall always fail to understand them and
to trace their social bearing. We must accept those
beliefs as they stand in their quaint concreteness, full
of contradictions and inconsistencies, and endeavour
<span class="pb" id="Pg214">[214]</span>
to mould our ideas upon the given folkloristic material,
of which an adequate knowledge is indispensable for
sociological purposes and gives us a very deep insight into
the mechanism of different social groups. So, for instance,
the aboriginal beliefs of reincarnation will be found
to be of some importance as regards the idea of kinship.</p>

<p>But let us return to our analysis of this aboriginal idea
of reincarnation. To define the word <em>exactly</em> the expression
of Baron Leonhardi may be accepted; reincarnation
means "that the given totemic ancestor himself continually
undergoes rebirth." In other words the belief
in reincarnation logically defined consists in a strict
identification of a given man with a given ancestor.
From this it is obvious that one would look in vain for
such a belief amongst the Australian savages, who do not
know anything of logic, and can neither affirm identity
nor perceive contradictions.<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor" title="M. Lévy-Bruhl writes: 'En appelant la mentalité primitive 'prélogique,' je veux seulement dire qu'elle ne s'astreint pas avant tout comme notre pensée, à s'abstenir de la contradiction. Elle obéit d'abord a la loi de participation.'--Loc. cit., p. 79.">[600]</a> Instead of identifying
two things, they feel only a strong but mystical bond of
union between them. In this sense the new-born child
is obviously a reincarnation of a given ancestor. For it is
"identical" with the spirit-child or <i>ratapa</i> of which it is
the incarnation, and this again is "identical" with a
given <ins id="C214" title="Abheringa">Alcheringa</ins>: obviously using the word "identity"

it may be said that the Central Australians regard
each man as the reincarnation of a given ancestor; this
being, of course, understood with the restriction here laid
down. Thus, any doubt as to this point&mdash;namely that
all human beings are reincarnations of <em>Alcheringa ancestors</em>&mdash;may
easily be set at rest.</p>

<p>There still remains, however, the question, much
more important to us, whether there be amongst these
tribes the belief in the reincarnation of <em>human ancestors</em>.
Strehlow's information seems absolutely to deny any
idea of repeated reincarnation;<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., ii. p. 56.">[604]</a> a man after death
goes to the <i>ltjarilkna-ala</i>, where after a certain time
his ghost undergoes perfect and final destruction.<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. 16, ii. 7.">[605]</a> A
man who has lived his life never returns. I confess that
to assume amongst savages the existence of such a neatly
defined and categorically-formulated belief in absolute
destruction or annihilation seems to me rather suspicious;
and there is perhaps some misunderstanding of a rather
theoretical character on the part of the Rev. C. Strehlow.
Moreover, we are informed by this latter author that
besides this belief in annihilation there are ideas according
to which the souls of "good" men go to heaven to
Altjira,<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor" title="The Altjira is the 'good god (?) of the Aranda,' i. p. 2.">[606]</a> and the souls of the "bad" people are eaten up

after death, and reincarnation is from this standpoint
<span class="pb" id="Pg216">[216]</span>
not impossible. And even if there were some belief as to
this annihilation, it might perfectly well be connected
by the natives with the ideas of reincarnation. The
primitive mind, as has often been urged, does not perceive
contradictions. It is not to negative instances that we
must look for an answer, but always to positive ones: if
we do find indications of a belief, we are then sure that it
exists, even if it were in contradiction with ever so many
others. If we do not find it, we can say nothing, and
especially we are not justified in proving its absence by
showing that it stands in contradiction with any of the
beliefs ascertained.</p>

<p>Now Spencer and Gillen adduce in several places concrete
instances of beliefs which prove beyond doubt
that the idea of the reincarnation of human beings actually
exists in the Central tribes. As this point is of some
importance in our present study, these instances must
be brought forward. One of them is the belief that
infants, who either die or are killed, soon undergo reincarnation.
Such a belief exists among the Arunta,<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 51.">[608]</a>
among the Kaitish and Unmatjera.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 506.">[609]</a> And again, in another
place, such a belief is reported to exist in all the tribes
examined by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen.<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 609.">[610]</a> That this
belief is deeply rooted is shown by the fact that it
serves as an excuse for the practice of infanticide; for
the natives believe that the same child will soon
undergo rebirth from the same mother. It might,
nevertheless, be objected that here rebirth is undergone
only by persons who died in infancy; and that this has
little connection with the reincarnation of ancestors
dead long ago. But, first, this belief is the proof of
the existence of reincarnation ideas in general, and
moreover there are better instances still. There has been
found amongst the Urabunna the belief that a person
at each reincarnation changes sex, class and totem.<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 148.">[611]</a>
The same belief in the alternation of sexes at each successive
<span class="pb" id="Pg217">[217]</span>
reincarnation is held amongst the Warramunga.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 358, footnote, and p. 530.">[612]</a>
The knowledge of these concrete and detailed beliefs
enables us to affirm without hesitation that the general
idea of the reincarnation of human beings exists among the
Central Australian tribes.<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor" title=" And probably among the Australian tribes in general.">[613]</a> A mere assertion on the part
of our informants might leave some doubts; but if they
adduce these beliefs in detail, the doubts can be only as
to their trustworthiness; and this is out of the question
in the present case. There are yet other facts confirming
the assumption we are dealing with. Messrs. Spencer
and Gillen give a detailed account of the wanderings and
doings of the ghost after death.<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 515.">[614]</a> They say expressly
that the ghost after a time goes to a certain place, where
it awaits reincarnation. A similar belief in a land where
the souls of the dead await reincarnation has been found
in the Adelaide tribes.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Mr. Thomas' article in Man (1904), p. 99, § 68, where he quotes Teichelman and Schürmann. The widespread belief that white men are dead people returned to life is a proof of the existence of beliefs in reincarnation.">[615]</a> So that, dividing the problem
of reincarnation into two questions&mdash;Is there among the
Central Australians (1) a belief in a reincarnation of the
Alcheringa ancestors? (2) a belief in the reincarnation of
human ancestors?&mdash;both must be answered in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>To sum up our somewhat extensive discussion of the
totemic beliefs of conception, we may say that the collective
ideas of the Central and North Central Australian<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor" title="Including the tribes recently investigated by Prof. B. Spencer.">[616]</a>
aborigines ignore expressly and explicitly any connection
of blood between a father and his child, and probably
greatly reduce the importance of the maternal blood tie;
that even allowing for the greatest amount of physiological
knowledge amongst these aborigines, there cannot be
any question of paternal consanguinity. We have seen
further that in all these Central and North Central tribes
<span class="pb" id="Pg218">[218]</span>
(and possibly in many others too) there is an idea of
reincarnation, not only of the Alcheringa, but also of the
human ancestors; the word reincarnation being used in
the sense indicated above, <a href="#Pg214">page 214</a>.</p>

<p>So far the results regarding parental, and especially
paternal, kinship are purely negative; there is between
father and child no <em>consanguinity</em>.<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor" title="Compare above, pp. 176 sqq., for discussion of this term.">[617]</a> But is there no
kinship? According to the theory of kinship sketched
above, individual parental kinship must be accepted as
existing in the Central no less than in all the other
Australian tribes, for the reasons already specified. And,
as was said above, and will be discussed again, it is even
possible on the basis of the evidence extant to give an
account of the emotional character of this relation. The
greatest difficulty is to know what idea the aborigines
themselves form concerning it; in other words, how is
fatherhood determined in the collective psychology of
the natives? Some indications at least of what we
look for may be found.</p>

<p>If we examine the different items of the folk-lore,
traditions, beliefs and customs of the Arunta, we can at
first sight hardly discover any ideas that bear upon our
subject. Fortunately, in the case of some of the Northern
tribes, we are in possession of information which appears
highly suggestive in regard to our problem. The Gnanji
and Umbaia tribes of the Northern territory share the
belief in totemic conception with all the more Southern
tribes. But amongst them the child is always of the
same totem as its father, wherever conception may have
taken place. These tribes have a theory to reconcile
these two beliefs that apparently are incompatible, viz.
descent of totem in paternal line and birth by incarnation
of a spirit-child.<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor" title="See Spencer and Gillen, Nor. Tr., pp. 169 sqq.">[618]</a> They believe that spirits of the
husband's totem follow the wife wherever the married
couple may go, and that one of these spirit individuals
enters the woman's body whenever it pleases; no spirit-child
<span class="pb" id="Pg219">[219]</span>
of any other totem could enter her. The infant is
therefore always of the husband's totem, and it is the
<em>reincarnation of this individual spirit</em> which has chosen
to follow the man and his wife on their wanderings. In
this belief there are, undoubtedly, contained ideas of a
strong tie of sympathy, affinity or kinship between the
father and his future child. In the first place the spirit-child,
which undergoes reincarnation, belongs to the
totem of the husband; but that does not as yet create
any individual relation between the father and the child,
although it constitutes a bond of totemic kinship between
them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it must be remembered that the individual
spirit-child, which sometimes has even to follow the
married couple on their wanderings, chooses its mother
on account of her husband and not in all probability on
her own; for it is not of her totem, and it is improbable
that the natives assume ties of preference between two
beings of different clans, if there are at hand two members
of the same clan&mdash;the father and the reincarnated child.
Now this act of choosing, this special preference of a certain
woman on account of her husband, clearly points to
a very close tie between father and child. Unfortunately,
the writers who report the beliefs in question have not
investigated the side we have discussed, and as all hypothetical
inferences are dangerous in sociology, we must
consider this belief to be highly suggestive but nothing
more. Nevertheless, setting one against another the two
facts&mdash;the social existence of a close tie between father
and child on the one hand (as we can affirm it on the
ground of the emotional character of this relationship),
and the existence of a belief that the reincarnated spirit-child
is of the father's totem, and is, so to say, attached
to him in his roaming life&mdash;it is difficult not to suspect
some inner connection between them. Now, if our supposition
is right, and if this belief has its social influence
in defining fatherhood, it may be said that in the Gnanji
and Umbaia tribes the essence of fatherhood is seen in
<span class="pb" id="Pg220">[220]</span>
the fact that a given man has determined a given spirit-child
to take up its abode in his wife's body, and that the
close tie of kinship lies in this mutual affinity or attraction
exercised by the man on the spirit-child. This is hypothetical,
but we may note another statement of Spencer
and Gillen's which appears to bear upon our subject and
corroborates our first hypothetical assumption.</p>

<p>We read that in the three coastal tribes of the Northern
territory&mdash;Binbinga, Anula and Mara&mdash;the natives are
very clear upon the point that the spirit-children know
which are the right <i>lubra</i> for them respectively to enter,
and each one deliberately chooses his or her own mother.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 174. The same is related in the recent note of Prof. B. Spencer (Athenæum, Nov. 4, 1911, p. 562). We read there: 'The spirit-children know into what woman they must enter.'">[619]</a>
Now descent in these tribes is strictly paternal both as
regards totems and classes.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., pp. 119, 172. Compare N. W. Thomas, loc. Cit. Map No. 1, facing p. 40.">[620]</a> This means that the father
determines the class and totem of his child. We must
assume, therefore, that the spirit-child chooses its mother
chiefly in regard to her husband, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> its future father.
It may, therefore, be once more repeated here that such
an act of preference involves the idea of a very close tie
between the spirit-child and the father; whether this
idea is a real kinship idea, that is, whether it has its positive
influence upon the different functions of the relationship
in question, is not mentioned by our informants,
and it would be quite vain to speculate upon the subject.
But again, putting the two items&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> the belief in
question and the existence of a close tie of kinship&mdash;side
by side, it is difficult to deny that a connection between
them appears very probable.</p>

<p>A similar social part appears also to be played by the
most general belief connected with the question of birth&mdash;the
belief in reincarnation. The question whether these
beliefs may be assumed in the Arunta has been discussed
at length, and an affirmative conclusion has been arrived
<span class="pb" id="Pg221">[221]</span>
at. Moreover, it has been seen that this belief appears
to be almost universal in Australia, and that it is reported
by many writers. There seems to be some reason for
assuming that this belief may possibly have some bearing
on the aboriginal ideas of kinship. As the child is
an incarnation not only of a spirit individual, and consequently
of an Alcheringa ancestor, but also in the majority
of cases of a series of human ancestors, it comes into this
world with an already formed personality, and it stands
in a definite relation to an Alcheringa ancestor; to a Nanja
place and to a given Churinga; it has its place in a totemic
group and in a class. We may, therefore, reasonably
assume that among other attributes the child brings its
individual kinship, derived from some vague ideas about
a former life, with it into the world. In other words,
the child is probably supposed already at its birth
to stand in a definite kinship relation (dating from a
mutual previous existence) towards its individual parents.
In fact, if the child comes into the world as a member
of other social groups, it may be taken as very probable
that it comes as the individual kinsman of its
father and mother. Father, mother and child have
already lived in the past; they may already have stood
in a very close relationship; perhaps they have even
been members of the same individual family.</p>

<p>This supposition may appear at first sight highly
hypothetical; plausible perhaps, but nothing more; yet
there are other facts which in considerable measure
support it. There is the belief that the spirit part of a
child which is killed, or dies in infancy, comes to <ins id="C221" title="ife">life</ins>
again by and by, and undergoes incarnation in the same
woman.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor" title="Compare above, p. 216.">[621]</a> In this belief we see that the ties of individual
kinship, once established, do not give way after death,
and that they determine the rebirth of the child. This
belief may be a special case of a more general one, viz.
that rebirth in all cases is determined by ties of individual
kinship established in a former life. There is yet another
<span class="pb" id="Pg222">[222]</span>
series of beliefs leading more directly to the same conclusion.
I mean the well-known fact that white men
were considered to be returned dead relatives, and
treated accordingly. We know that there were several
cases in which the life of a man was saved by this belief.
The best known is the case of Buckley, a run-away
convict, who lived about thirty years among the natives.
He was treated with the greatest kindness and tenderness
by his "relatives."<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor" title="J. Morgan, Life and Adventures of William Buckley (Hobart, 1852). The value of this book and especially of the ethnographic information contained in it, has been disputed by Bonwick. See J. Bonwick, William Buckley, the Wild White Man (Melbourne, 1856), p. 7. I have not used Morgan's book as a source. The life-story of Morgan told therein is admittedly authentic.">[622]</a> The same tokens of affection are
related to have been shown to a settler in the vicinity
of Perth by his "parents," who merely to see him
would travel more than sixty leagues through a country
which was in parts dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor" title="Stokes, quoted by M. Lévy-Bruhl, loc. cit., p. 400.">[623]</a> In another place we are
informed that a white convict identified with a dead
relative was presented with a piece of land which
"belonged to him by right." Similar statements are
numerous.<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor" title="Another instance where a white woman was received by a man as his daughter and accepted into the tribe and into all her rights and relationships, is told by Macgillivray, loc. cit., i., p. 303. She was shipwrecked, came into the power of the natives, and, of course, lived in a very miserable condition. Her only comfort was derived from the man who imagined that she was his reborn daughter. ...">[624]</a> In order to establish the relevancy of these
facts to our problem, it may be remarked that the most
important features of the beliefs in question are (1) that
<span class="pb" id="Pg223">[223]</span>
white men are identified with a given dead individual,
(2) that they get then <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> a definite place in the
tribe, in the local group, and&mdash;what is most important
as regards the present question&mdash;in the individual family.
The belief that people after death become white may
account for the identification of white men with the dead.
But the fact that in ever so many cases a white man was
identified with a certain individual, and became thereby
entitled to a social position, implies some additional
beliefs. One of these beliefs is the idea of rebirth or
reincarnation that we have established above in another
way. The other collective idea, which must be assumed
in order to explain the ease and readiness with which
feelings of affection as well as worldly goods were
bestowed upon these alleged relatives, is that in the
ordinary form in which dead men return to this life,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> in reincarnation by birth, each individual brings
with him, or her, full social position, including individual
relationship. And this is the point at issue in the present
discussion. The fact that white men were recognized as
dead relatives compels us to assume that children&mdash;who
were considered as reborn men&mdash;were also accepted as
relatives. If the natives had not their mind turned that
way, if they were not used to identify every new member
of their society with some ancestor of their own, could
they do it so easily in the case of white men, who were so
different from them, and could not present any striking
physical similarity? Of course this inference is not a
cogent one. But putting side by side all the facts we
have gathered: the belief in reincarnation of the dead;
the easy recognition of dead relatives in white men; and
the promptitude with which, in some cases, the latter
were given their places in society, their hunting-grounds,
their parents, relatives, and so on&mdash;all this allows us to
affirm with a high degree of probability that a new-born
child was looked upon as a reincarnated member
of the tribe, and that an intimate kinship between
him and his parents was considered to be established
<span class="pb" id="Pg224">[224]</span>
on the ground of kinship in a previous life. Is not
the parental affection which was bestowed on some
of the white men one of the most astonishing traits
in the evidence in question? Of course white men
were considered to be immediate reincarnations, or
rather a return of the dead in ghost condition; whereas
rebirth was a much longer process, and was, perhaps,
considered as reincarnation of a long-dead ancestor.
Consequently the ties of kinship between a white man
and his "relatives" were the repetition of an actual
relation which had already existed for the native in his
life. Whereas if a reborn child is considered, as we here
assume, to be a "previous" kinsman, this kinship is
based upon a relation obtaining in some former existence.
But it may be urged that if we deal with aboriginal
collective psychology no very clear ideas can be expected.
The only thing that we assumed here was that
the ideas of rebirth, combined with some other specific
Australian beliefs, suggest very strongly that children
might have been both held, and felt to be, kindred, on
the ground that they come with some sort of ready-made
personality; and on the ground that, as E. S. Hartland
argues, rebirth is the result of some spontaneous action
of the creature to be reborn. I think that if we ask
for the source of the widespread belief in white men being
returned ghosts, and especially for the readiness and
ease with which they were accepted into the family
and into the tribe&mdash;we must presuppose some beliefs
and institutions to account for it, and the explanation
proposed above seems to me very plausible.<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor" title="Similar ideas have been enunciated by M. Lévy-Bruhl, loc. Cit., pp. 388-402. Some of the Australian facts are quoted and interpreted there in an analogous way. M. Lévy-Bruhl naturally does not enter into as many particulars as has been necessary here, but his conclusion, 'l'enfant-esprit qui se réincarne est déjà dans une relation determinée avec le père et la mère qui lui donnent naissance,' is nearly identical with what we have endeavoured to prove here. ...">[625]</a> But the
<span class="pb" id="Pg225">[225]</span>
best example of the ideas of kinship of the magic order
is to be found among the tribes studied and described
by W. E. Roth.</p>

<p>Before we proceed to the North Queensland tribes,
there may be mentioned some customs of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couvade</i>
type, referring to the Central tribes. These customs, as
has been said above, express an intimate connection
of a mystic character between father and child. They
also involve a considerable amount of paternal affection
and care for the welfare of the offspring, as they expose
the father to various inconveniences, privations and hardships
for the benefit of the child. Thus we read that
among the Central tribes the father has to observe certain
taboos and restrictions during the pregnancy of his
wife, otherwise she would have a difficult confinement.<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., pp. 466, 467.">[626]</a>
This only shows a connection between the behaviour
of the man and the act of birth. But we read in another
place that the non-observance of certain hunting taboos
by the man during the pregnancy of his wife would
have baleful consequences for the offspring.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., pp. 344, 607.">[627]</a> We
are informed, also, of a few functions of parental kin
expressed in different customs which accentuate the
intimacy of this relation. Thus the mother plays some
part in the initiation ceremonies,<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 250.">[628]</a> as well as in mourning
and funerals. Concerning the important social functions
of the father, I may quote what Mr. R. H. Mathews
writes about the Central tribes: "The privilege of working
incantations, making rain, performing initiatory ceremonies,
and other important functions, descends from the
men of the tribe to the sons."<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor" title="Trans. R.S.N.S.W. (1907), p. 75.">[629]</a> Moreover all the ceremonies
in common with totems "are likewise handed
down through the men."<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 77.">[630]</a> We see from this that
many important social functions descend from father
to son. Messrs. Spencer and Gillen report that the
position of the Alatunja is hereditary amongst the
<span class="pb" id="Pg226">[226]</span>
Arunta.<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 10.">[631]</a> And similarly the position of the headman is
hereditary amongst the Northern tribes.<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., p. 23.">[632]</a> All these facts
serve on the one hand socially to define individual
kinship, and on the other to show that there exist
certain ideas of a mystic bond between father and child.
How far these ideas, as expressed in the customs of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couvade</i> type, harmonize with the ideas dealt with above,
it is quite impossible to know. It may be said that in
both respects we have hints showing the existence of
ideas on kinship, but that we can by no means go beyond
mere supposition when we try to reconstruct these ideas
and to find some mutual connection. Let us now pass
to the other tribes.</p>

<p>The belief in a supernatural cause of pregnancy is
spread not only all over the Central and North Central
area, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> among all the tribes included in the researches
of Spencer and Gillen.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 330.">[633]</a> The same ignorance of physiological
fatherhood is found in the whole of the Northern
territory, in Queensland, and probably in West Australia.
We read that among the tribes of the North-West territory

And we read in Dr. Frazer's new work: "The view is

In point of fact, I am informed by the Bishop of North

all the tribes with which he is acquainted both in North
Queensland and in Central Australia, including the
Arunta; not only are the natives in their savage states
ignorant of the true cause of conception, but they do not
readily believe it even after their admission into mission
stations, and their incredulity has to be reckoned with in
the efforts of the clergy to introduce a higher standard
of sexual morality among them."<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor" title="Tot. and Exog., i. pp. 576, 577.">[635]</a> This is a very strong
<span class="pb" id="Pg227">[227]</span>
proof of the depth of these beliefs, and of the absolute
ignorance of the natives on this point.<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor" title="That the ignorance in question was complete is also the opinion of Mr. E. S. Hartland, loc. cit., ii. pp. 275, 276. He adduces several reasons and statements in support of it. Compare also what we said above about the completeness of this ignorance among the Central tribes.">[636]</a> In the South-Eastern
region this belief is to be found as far as the Northern
part of New South Wales. We have statements of
Mrs. Parker<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 50, 61, 98.">[637]</a> which, although not very clear, seem at
least to imply a great amount of magical beliefs as to
procreation, if not complete ignorance of the physiological
part borne by the father. With regard to the Western
tribes, Mrs. Bates writes in a letter to Mr. Lang<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor" title="See Man (1906), p. 180.">[638]</a>: "They
did not believe that procreation had anything to do with
conception."</p>

<p>That in spite of this absence of any kind of consanguinity,
especially in the father's case, there exists
in the Queensland tribes an individual kinship relation
between both parents and their children, is clear from
the statements collected on <a href="#Pg245">page 245</a>, and from the
conclusion on <a href="#Pg249">page 249</a>, to which the reader may be
referred, as well as to the theoretical conclusion on <a href="#Pg198">page
198</a>. Looking at the rich and interesting collection of
folk-lore of these tribes given by Mr. W. E. Roth, it
will be possible to find the way in which fatherhood is
determined by the animistic ideas of the aborigines.
As just said, among the North-West Central Queensland
tribes, the causal nexus between conception and copulation
is not known. We read in Roth that, according to
aboriginal ideas, there are several ways in which a child
may enter a woman's body: it may be inserted into her
in a dream; she may be told by a man that she will be
pregnant and so on. But in whatever mode the child
has come, "the recognized husband accepts it as his
own without demur."<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor" title="Roth, Bull. V. p. 22, § 81.">[639]</a> This phrase seems to point to
the fact that a man has certain ways of recognizing a
<span class="pb" id="Pg228">[228]</span>
child as his own, and ideas under which he conceives
this tie.</p>

<p>In fact we read that man possesses several "souls" or
vital principles. One of them, <i>ngai</i>, leaves the body soon
after death; if the deceased was a male his <i>ngai</i> "passes
into his children, both boys and girls equally." The <i>ngai</i>
of a female goes to her sister or passes away. Nobody
has a <i>ngai</i> before his father dies, but receives his father's
<i>ngai</i> after the latter's death.<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor" title="Roth, Bull. V. p. 18, § 68. This refers to the Pennefather River tribes.">[640]</a> This is an important
connection, which by itself might very well serve to establish
the most intimate tie of kinship. The child is
supposed to be its father's spirit's heir. It shares in his
most personal and individual element. Is this spiritual
communion not something quite as strong and deep as
any community of blood?</p>

<p>In another tribe of this area there is a similar belief
concerning the <i>choi</i> (another "soul"). The aborigines of
Pennefather River believe that babies are made out of
swamp mud and then inserted into the wombs of women
by a being called Anjea. Now it is particularly important
for us to note that Anjea animates the baby with a piece
of its father's spirit if it is a boy, and with a piece of its
father's sister's spirit if it is a girl. For each new baby
Anjea provides a new piece of spirit. But he does not
take these pieces from the spirit of the living father or
his sister. He has a special source from which to take it;
he takes it from the father's or father's sister's afterbirth.
When a child is born a portion of its spirit stays in its
afterbirth. Hence the grandmother takes the afterbirth
and buries it in the sand, and marks the place by thrusting
sticks into the ground. So when Anjea comes along
and sees it, he knows where to look for the father's (or
father's sister's) spirit, which he wants in order to animate
the new baby. And in this way all babies are animated
by a spiritual part of their father or paternal aunts.<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[641]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg229">[229]</span>
Both these examples illustrate perfectly well the
general definition of kinship ideas we have given above.
Here the relation between father and child is established
in the native ideas by a purely spiritual connection. But
obviously this connection is a very important one. The
deep tie between a man and his child is here explicitly
indicated and not inferred by us, as in the foregoing cases,
in which we could only state that the beliefs and facts
point to such a tie. In the present case the father's
spirit is the material from which the child's soul is to be
built up. It is not his bodily germ that procreates the
child, but his spiritual germ. What does it matter that
the mother gives birth to the child? The latter is animated
by the father's (or father's sister's) spirit, and this
spiritual connection is of course as strong a bond of
kinship as can possibly be imagined.</p>

<p>There is in the second of these examples a complication
produced by the fact that a female child is not
animated by her father's, but by her father's sister's,
spirit. But this complication is more apparent than real.
We must always remember that the aborigines do not
think in clearly defined ideas, and that there is always a
question rather of some broad emotional connection than
of a tie logically apprehended. And here the connection
between the female children and their father is broadly
marked by the spiritual tie between his sister and the
children. It may be said that "spiritual propagation"
follows the male line exclusively, for all children are
animated by a spirit taken from their father or his sister.</p>

<p>We have still a few examples to quote where there
appears to be involved a tie between father and child
established on other grounds than the sexual act. In
some of the North Queensland tribes (Cairns district)
"the acceptance of food from a man by a woman was not
merely regarded as a marriage ceremony, but as the
actual cause of conception."<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor" title="J. G. Frazer, Tot. and Exog., i. p. 577, on the authority of Bishop Frodsham.">[642]</a> A similar belief obtains
<span class="pb" id="Pg230">[230]</span>
among the Larrekiya and Wogait of Port Darwin. "The
old men say that there is an evil spirit who takes babies
from a big fire and places them in the wombs of women,
who must then give birth to them. When in the ordinary
course of events a man is out hunting and kills game or
gathers vegetable food, he gives it to his wife, who must
eat it, believing that the food will cause her to conceive
and bring forth a child. When the child is born, it may
on no account partake of the particular food which produced
conception until it has got its first teeth."<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor" title="H. Basedow, loc. cit., quoted by Frazer, Tot. and Exog., i. p. 576.">[643]</a> In
these cases we might look also for some material from
which the ideas of individual paternity might have been
evolved, but this is a supposition merely, which obviously
is much less well founded than our inferences referring to
the Central and North Central tribes.</p>

<p>Let us turn to another portion of the continent, to the
South-Eastern tribes, where the natives have to a certain
extent inverse ideas on procreation. They seem to know
that conception is due to copulation. But they exaggerate
the father's part. The children are begotten "by
him exclusively; the mother receives only the germ and
nurtures it; the aborigines ... never for a moment
feel any doubt ... that the children originate solely
from the male parent, and only owe their infantine nurture
to their mother."<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, J.A.I., xii. p. 502.">[644]</a> This theory is not a logical and consistent
one, but none of the aboriginal views possess these
qualities! But this theory of procreation is quite clear
and categorical in acknowledging exclusively what seems
to the native mind important for the formation of consanguineous
ties in the act of procreation. Let us adduce
the examples in detail, as they are very instructive. The
Wirdajuri nation<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor" title="Cameron, J.A.I., xiv. p. 351.">[645]</a> believe that the child "emanates from
the father solely, being only nurtured by its mother."
There is a strong tie of kinship between the child and the
father; the latter nevertheless has not the right to dispose
<span class="pb" id="Pg231">[231]</span>
of his daughter in marriage; that is done by the mother
and the mother's brother. We see here that curiously
enough strong paternal consanguinity coincides with
weakening of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patria potestas</i> (provided the information
be accurate on both points). For disposal of the
daughter is one of the chief features of a parent's authority
over the child. Among the Wolgal the child belongs to
the father, and he only "gives it to his wife to take care
of for him."<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor" title="Aboriginal phrase quoted by Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 198.">[646]</a> This is probably an interpretation of the
facts of procreation. In this tribe the father disposes
of his daughter; in fact "he could do what he liked"
with her on the ground of his exclusive right to the child.
Here, apparently, the ideas on kinship enhance the
paternal authority. A strong proof of this unilateral
paternal consanguinity is given yet more in detail in the
case of the Kulin tribes. There, according to a native
expression, "the child comes from the man, the woman
only takes care of it."<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 255.">[647]</a> And when once an old man
wished to emphasize his right and authority over his son
he said: "Listen to me! I am here, and there you
stand with my body."<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[648]</a> This is clearly a claim to
kinship on the basis of consanguinity. It is interesting
to note that in the examples just quoted this consanguineous
kinship seems to give some claims to authority.
Analogously amongst the Yuin the child belonged to his
father "because his wife merely takes care of his children
for him."<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 263.">[649]</a></p>

<p>Withal this information leaves us in the dark about
the detailed working of these ideas. Especially we are
not quite clear whether the assertions of "being of the
same body," of "belonging to him," etc., do actually
refer to the act of procreation, whether they form an
interpretation of this act, or whether they have quite a
different basis; although it seems from the expressions
quoted above that the first alternative is the right one.
On the other hand, when we read that the mother only
<span class="pb" id="Pg232">[232]</span>
nurtures the child, that she merely takes care of it and so
on, does it mean that the aboriginal mind <em>decrees</em> or
interprets that during pregnancy the mother is a kind of
nurse only, that she is the soil in which the father has
deposited the seed? And as the relation between the
plant and the seed is closer than that between the plant
and the soil, so the relation between father and child is
nearer than that between mother and child? All this is
left to hypothesis, strongly supported by the statements,
but unfortunately not affirmed by them in a clear and
unambiguous way. We are not at all sure whether all
these ideas, instead of being theories of the act of impregnation,
have not some mystic, legendary basis like the
beliefs of the Queenslander dealt with above.</p>

<p>A survey of different points of Australian folk-lore has
been made in order to find some kinship ideas corresponding
to the definition given on <a href="#Pg183">page 183</a>. From all
the results obtained, the most certain and best founded
one is the negative fact that the majority of the Australian
tribes are wholly ignorant of the physiological process of
procreation. This result, although at first sight a negative
one, leads, when viewed in the proper light, to sociological
conclusions of some importance. In regard to the discussion
on consanguinity (given <a href="#Pg176">pp. 176</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>), it follows from
this fact that we cannot speak of paternal consanguinity
among these tribes in the social sense of this word,<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor" title="It has been already remarked above on page 179, that there can be no question of physiological consanguinity for other reasons.">[650]</a> and
that the individual tie of kinship, which does nevertheless
exist between father and child, must be conceived of by the
natives in some different way. This conclusion is also
very important, for it obviously tears asunder the intimate
connection between the sexual side of marriage and kinship,
a connection that has often been assumed hitherto.
The lack of sexual exclusiveness found in Australia does
not affect the structure of the individual family, of which
kinship is the index. Waiving the question whether
this holds good for primitive mankind in general, it may
<span class="pb" id="Pg233">[233]</span>
be assumed as quite a final result for the majority of
Australian tribes.</p>

<p>The positive ideas of kinship enumerated in this survey
fulfil the two conditions set up on <a href="#Pg183">page 183</a>; they refer
to the individual relation between father and child,<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor" title="Defined at first only as members of the same individual family.">[651]</a> and
they affirm a close tie between the two. But in order to
prove that such ideas are sociologically relevant ideas of
kinship, it must yet be shown that they possess some
social functions; that is to say, that they play an essential
part in the collective formulation of the various norms
regulating individual parental kinship. Now it was not
possible to find any data on this point, so this gap remains
unfilled, and therefore the results arrived at here
must be considered as incomplete. It was necessary to
introduce the conjectural assumption that all the facts
known which give sociological evidence of individual
parental kinship stand in close connection with the beliefs
in question. Nevertheless, this assumption is neither
arbitrary nor scientifically barren, as far as I see. It
may first be remarked that the complete absence in our
ethnographic information of any attempt to connect the
data of folk-lore and the facts of sociology is not astonishing
at all, as it is the consequence of one of the shortcomings
in social science at the present day. This lack is due to
reasons connected with the ethnographer and not with
the material. The intimate relation which must exist
between social beliefs and social functions was quite a
sufficient justification for the introduction of this assumption.
Moreover, this assumption, although hypothetical,
lies quite within the limits of verification. A conjectural
assumption referring to facts which lie necessarily outside
the reach of observation, incurs much more the
risk of scientific barrenness. But this cannot be the case
with new points of view, the enunciation of which imposes
itself as an inevitable logical inference, and which, being
capable of verification, may serve as a fertile working
hypothesis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<span class="pb" id="Pg234">[234]</span><br />
<small>PARENTS AND CHILDREN</small></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Consideration may first here be given to the cares
and benefits a child receives from its mother during the
first few years of its infancy. These facts constitute a
very strong bond of union between the child and its nurse.
Suckling is a physiological tie between the child and the
mother, and next to the fact of birth it marks very strongly
the individuality of this relation. Group motherhood
has therefore never been a very popular idea and has
never found a favourable reception amongst sociologists.
We saw above, however, that it is very probable that the
facts of birth may lack any social significance in the
native mind. If it be further possible to imagine in
the same tribe suckling performed, according to Dr.
Rivers's suggestion,<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor" title="Compare above, p. 6.">[652]</a> not by the actual mother, but by a
group of kindred women, group motherhood would be
quite comprehensible in such tribes.</p>

<p>In Australia, however, suckling seems to be strictly
individual. This might indeed be inferred in the first
place from the aboriginal mode of living. Communism
in suckling and rearing a small child would involve
a complete communism in life; and we know that
unless two women are wives of the same man, they are
to a great extent isolated in daily life. It is also highly
improbable that in the two or three families which are
roaming together there would be always a woman at
hand who could help the other in these cares.</p>

<p>There are several other reasons which still more strongly
<span class="pb" id="Pg235">[235]</span>
support our view. The best argument may be deduced
from the statements referring to infanticide. It is
practised amongst all Australian natives. One of the
chief reasons given for it is that the mother cannot possibly
suckle and carry two children at one time, especially as
children are not weaned before their third to fifth year.
If there were a custom of common suckling and nursing
a child, and another woman who would replace the mother
in her functions could be easily found, the practice of
infanticide could scarcely be attributed to the above-mentioned
reasons. Let us adduce a few statements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Statements.</i>&mdash;Infanticide is carried on among the Lower
Darling natives to prevent the toils and troubles of carrying
and caring for too many children. The mother's brother
decides if the child should be killed or not.<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor" title="Bonney, J.A.I., xiii. p. 125.">[653]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Encounter Bay natives "no mother will
venture to bring up more than two children, because she
considers that the attention which she would have to devote
to them would interfere with what she regards as the duty
to her husband in searching for roots, etc."<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor" title="Meyer in Woods, pp. 186, 187.">[654]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Adelaide tribes "female infants at birth are
not infrequently put to death for the sake of more valuable
boys who are still being suckled."<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor" title="Wyatt in Woods, p. 162.">[655]</a></p>

<p>As justification of infanticide "women plead that they
cannot suckle and carry two children together."<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor" title="Chas. Wilhelmi, quoted by Br. Smyth, i. p. 51. (Port Lincoln Tribes.)">[656]</a> It is
clear from this statement that the impossibility of suckling
more than one child at a time is given as justification for
infanticide by the <em>natives themselves</em>; and that it is not only
an inference of the observer.</p>

<p>Infanticide was practised among the Port Lincoln tribes.
"In extenuation of this horrible practice the women allege
that they cannot suckle and carry two babies at once."<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor" title="Schürmann in Woods, p. 224.">[657]</a> This
statement also quite unmistakably points to the fact that
children were suckled and attended by their own mother.</p>

<p>Bennett writes that among the New South Wales natives
women practice infanticide in order to avoid too much trouble
in carrying their infants about.<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. pp. 123, 124.">[658]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg236">[236]</span>
Another statement, maintaining still more strongly the view
that only the mother suckled her child, is that of Collins.<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor" title="Collins, i. pp. 607, 608.">[659]</a>
He says that he knew two instances in which infants were
killed by the father at their mother's grave, the reason alleged
being that as no one else could be found to suckle the child
and to rear it it must have died a worse death. Collins
supposes that this is a general custom.</p>

<p>Gason states that among the Dieri nearly thirty per cent.
of the children were destroyed by their mothers at birth to
avoid the cares and trouble of rearing.<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor" title="In Woods, p. 258.">[660]</a></p>

<p>"The Arunta native does not hesitate to kill a child&mdash;always
directly it is born&mdash;if there be an older one still in
need of nourishment from the mother; and suckling is continued
up to the age of three years and even older."<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 264.">[661]</a> And
again: "The child is killed ... when the mother is ...
unable to rear it owing to there being a young child whom
she is still feeding."<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 51.">[662]</a></p>

<p>Among the Kabi and Wakka: "The motive for infanticide
with these tribes could not be to save food in times of dearth,
for the food supply was constant and plentiful. It would
be mainly, if not entirely, that mothers might escape the
irksomeness of nursing and caring for infants and of carrying
them on their frequent journeys."<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor" title="Mathew, p. 166.">[663]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. D. M. Bates writes that when a mother died at childbirth
the infant was put to death.<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 50.">[664]</a> We are not informed
what reasons the natives gave for this practice; but most
probably they are the same as those mentioned by Collins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this evidence makes it nearly impossible to suppose
that suckling, carrying the baby and caring for it, was
the task of a group of women. For then it would not be
necessary to kill the infant at the death of its mother, or
to kill it when there was another one to be suckled, as the
toils could easily be shared by the other women of the
group. The assumption we are now able to draw,
namely that the mother always suckles and nurses her
own child, is of great importance.<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor" title="It is very important to note that this individual rearing is, in all probability, deeply connected with the aboriginal mode of life; viz. their scattered manner of living in small groups and their roaming habits. Both these latter seem to be, on the other hand, dependent upon the economic conditions of the stage of primitive hunting and fishing, and it may be assumed that all lower races have passed through, broadly speaking, the same circumstances of life; ...">[665]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg237">[237]</span>
Amongst the Australian aborigines suckling establishes
undoubtedly much stronger bonds between mother and
child than amongst civilized races, for it lasts much longer.
As we saw and shall see in a few statements, the child is
never weaned before its third year, and sometimes suckling
lasts much longer. Between a bigger child and its mother
this constant dependence upon each other must necessarily
create a strong bond of union. The child must be
continually with its mother. During infancy it is carried
by her in a pouch or bag on the shoulders. Afterwards
it accompanies her on all her wanderings and in all her
work. A great addition to her work is the continuous
care she must display towards it. This will be exemplified
in our statements referring to the economic division of
labour. To sum up, we may say that natural necessities
of nurture and of the earliest cares, combined with the
aboriginal mode of living, make the child absolutely
dependent on the personal, individual help it receives
from its mother, and creates therefore an intimate relation
between the two.</p>

<p>This is not so much in evidence as regards the relationship
between the father and child. But here it must be
remembered that owing to the character of the native
mode of living the man lives in close contact and to a
great extent in isolation with his wife, and consequently
also with his wife's children. Some of our statements
show that he shares to a certain extent in the cares and
labours connected with carrying children, feeding them,
etc.; he seems to have a great affection towards them and
never to treat them with severity. So that we may infer
that the general character of his feelings is of the same
description as that of the mother's, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> one of parental
love and attachment.</p>

<h3>II<span class="pb" id="Pg238">[238]</span></h3>

<p>An attempt will be made to illustrate by a series of
statements all these characteristics of domestic life as
far as they embrace the relations of parents to children.
The chief points of inquiry will be: Is there between
parents and children any kind of affection? What is
the general character of the treatment of children by
parents? Are rudiments of education given by father or
mother to their offspring? In what way does the position
of the father differ from that of the mother&mdash;is there any
special trait of severity? In what consists the paternal
authority and how does it show itself? Is there any
strong difference made between male and female children?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Statements.</i>&mdash;"In infancy the young Kurnai is an object
of love and pride to its father and mother. From observation
of various tribes in far distant parts of Australia, I can assert
confidently that love for their children is a marked feature
in the aboriginal character. I cannot recollect having ever
seen a parent beat or cruelly use a child; and a short road to
the good-will of parents is, as amongst us, by noticing and
admiring their children." The greatest grief is exhibited at the
death of a child by all the relatives in a camp. These observations
refer as well to the Kurnai and the other South-Eastern
tribes, as to the Dieri, of whom the author gives an illustrative
story.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Kam. and Kurn., p. 189.">[666]</a> The boy lives with his parents and "is very much
under the control of his mother."&mdash;This statement is very
valuable. It gives us the opinion of perhaps our best
Australian observer on the psychology of parental feelings; it
refers to all the tribes known to Howitt, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> to a very extensive
area. And it states in plain terms that the feelings of love and
affection for children which form the chief characteristic of
parental relations are to be found with an intensity which is
as strong as that prevailing in our society. In another place
the same author quotes an instance "of a mother watching
her sick child and refusing all food, and when it died she was
inconsolable."<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 766.">[667]</a></p>

<p>Curr says that among the Bangerang the father had absolute
authority over his children.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor" title="Recollections, p. 278.">[668]</a> In another place he says
that the father had to decide in case of infanticide and in
every more important occasion of the child's life.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, A.R., i. p. 76.">[669]</a> But we
<span class="pb" id="Pg239">[239]</span>
read: "Parents were much attached to their children and
rarely punished or corrected them." Not only did they not
control them (although occasionally a child was beaten in a fit
of anger),<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor" title="A similar statement is given by Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 51.">[670]</a> but "they were habitually indulged in every way;
and as a consequence, in case of the boys at least, grew up as
self-willed, thorough little tyrants as can well be imagined."<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor" title="Recollections, p. 252.">[671]</a></p>

<p>In his general book on Australia the same author gives us
some more information on family life. The father makes
small weapons as toys for his sons. The children are seldom
chastised and they are very independent. The real training
of the boys begins when they leave their parents' camp and
undergo the series of initiations.<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor" title="A.R., i. p. 71.">[672]</a> These statements point
also unmistakably to feelings of attachment and love, which
are, as we tried to prove above, the very essence of family ties.
The father seems to care as much as the mother for his children's
education, and he is very kind and lenient to them.</p>

<p>As a crude and pathetic example of maternal love there is
the case reported by Angas, of a mother carrying for ten years
the corpse of her dead child.<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 75.">[673]</a> Similar cases are reported by
Howitt about the Kurnai.<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., p. 244.">[674]</a></p>

<p>We find many statements referring to this subject in
the compilation of Br. Smyth. I mention them only
shortly, as the author was never directly acquainted with
the aboriginal life, and we value him only when he quotes
some little-known authorities, or gives actual facts gathered
for him by his correspondents. He speaks of the heavy
task of a woman having to carry her babe, besides all
the other work and trouble of a journey.<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. p. 47.">[675]</a> The father
occasionally nurses the baby too and is very fond of it.<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[676]</a>
The child is suckled for three years; it is carried in an
opossum rug during infancy and attended to solely by its
mother.<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor" title="Mr. John Green (superintendent of a station, see vol. i. p. vi.), quoted by Br. Smyth, i. p. 78.">[677]</a> A description of the way in which an opossum
rug is dried is given.<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 48. Another description of the mode of child-carrying is given by Basedow, Jour. and Proc. R.S.S.A. (1907), xxxi.">[678]</a> In another passage the same author
speaks again of the general kindness, affection and indulgence
of parents to children, as of a well-known fact. He adds
besides that the parents were very judicious in the treatment
of their children.<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor" title="Br. Smyth, i. p. 51.">[679]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg240">[240]</span>
"As a general rule, both fathers and mothers are very
kind to their children and very rarely indeed strike them;
and I have been often amused at seeing a rebellious urchin, of
perhaps eight or nine years of age, take up his mimic spears,
run a few yards away and then hurl them with all his force
at his mother." "They are very fond of their children, and
will at any time venture their lives for them."<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor" title="J. Moore Davis in Br. Smyth, ii. p. 311. He speaks in this article indiscriminately of South Australians.">[680]</a> And
the author tells of an occurrence in corroboration.<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor" title="Referring to natives of Victoria.">[681]</a> Here,
again, we hear of kindness, leniency and real affection. The
instance of a native losing his life in trying to save his child
is very convincing.</p>

<p>The children that escape infanticide enjoy great affection
from their parents.<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor" title="Br. Smyth, ii. p. 290. Note on Australians, by A. Le Souëf. It refers, probably, to the Victorian blacks.">[682]</a></p>

<p>Of the Lower Darling River tribes it is stated that the
children are not only very leniently treated by their parents,
but that they are not spoilt at all. "One word from the
parent generally is sufficient to check a child when doing
wrong, and the greatest respect is shown to parents by their
children."<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor" title="Bonney, J.A.I., xiii. p. 126.">[683]</a> The loss of a child would be lamented by the whole
camp; the mother and near relatives would especially mourn.<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[684]</a>
A description of the mode of carrying children by their mother
is also given by the same author.<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[685]</a> In this statement we
may remark that the children are said not to be spoilt; this
does not agree quite with some of our other statements. But
this information agrees with all others in respect of the
affection and lenient treatment the children enjoy.</p>

<p>According to Mitchell children are carried by the mother
in skin bags on the shoulder. She carries also toys for her
children.<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor" title="Vol. i. pp. 332, 333.">[686]</a> As we have said above, the close connection
in life between child and mother must have been of importance
in making the tie between them especially close.
The existence of toys, mentioned already in J. M. Davis'
statement, characterizes the tender care bestowed on the
young folk by their parents.</p>

<p>"The child is brought up with great care.... Should
it cry, it is passed from one person to another and caressed
and soothed, and the father will frequently nurse it for several
hours together. When the child commences to walk, the
father gives it a name."<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor" title="Encounter Bay tribes (Narrinyeri), Meyer, loc. cit., pp. 186, 187.">[687]</a> They are long suckled&mdash;sometimes
<span class="pb" id="Pg241">[241]</span>
up to five or six years of age. A boy "when weaned, accompanies
his father upon short excursions, upon which
occasion the father takes every opportunity to instruct his
son. For instance, if they arrive at a place concerning which
they have any tradition, it is told to the child if old enough
to understand it. Or he shows him how to procure this or
that animal, or other article of food, in the easiest way."<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor" title="Encounter Bay tribes (Narrinyeri), Meyer, loc. cit., p. 187.">[688]</a>
We see here that the tie between father and child is a very
close one. The father nurses the child when it is small, and
educates it when it is bigger. Affection, care and kind treatment
are stated here as everywhere else. And again we
read: "If the father dies before a child is born, the child
is put to death by the mother."<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 186.">[689]</a> This marks again how
important is the father's part in bringing up a child.</p>

<p>Wyatt says of the Adelaide tribe that "they display strong
affection towards each other," which is shown especially in
a "great fondness for children."<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 162.">[690]</a></p>

<p>We read about the Port Lincoln tribes: "Both sexes are
very fond of their children."<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor" title="Chas. Wilhelmi, p. 181.">[691]</a></p>

<p>Howitt, speaking of infanticide among the Murring tribe,
adds: "Yet they are very fond of their offspring, and very
indulgent to those they keep, rarely striking them, and a
mother would give all the food she had to her children, going
hungry herself."<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 748; informant: H. Williams.">[692]</a> In several statements on infanticide
it is said that no difference was made between boys and girls.<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 748-750.">[693]</a>
Here again we have a strong assertion of parental love, and
of the kind treatment the children enjoy.</p>

<p>Among the Murrumbidgee tribes "it is well known that as
their children become older they [the parents] evince much
attachment towards them."<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor" title="Bennett, i. p. 123.">[694]</a> A well-known tragic instance of
parental love is reported about the New South Wales natives by
the same author. "They display an extraordinary degree of
affection for their dead offspring, evidenced by an act that
almost exceeds credibility, had it not so often been witnessed
among the tribes in the interior of the colony. I allude to
the fact of deceased children, from the earliest age to even
six or seven years, being placed in a bag made of kangaroo
skin, and slung upon the back of the mother.... They
carry them thus for ten or twelve months, sleeping upon the
mass of mortal remains, which serves them for a pillow,
apparently unmindful of the horrid fœtor which emanates
from such a putrefying substance."<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 125, 126.">[695]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg242">[242]</span>
G. S. Lang in his account of the Australian blacks speaks of
great leniency of treatment, and quotes several examples.<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor" title="p. 33. The author knew personally some tribes of New South Wales and Queensland.">[696]</a></p>

<p>An exceptional statement is given by a member of the
United States expedition. "As far as our observation went,
the women appear to take little care of their children."<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor" title="Chas. Wilkes (smaller ed.), i. p. 225.">[697]</a> But
we gather from the whole account that the authors had no
good opportunities of making observations on the natives,
if they had any at all. Probably the natives they saw were
in a state of deterioration, hanging round towns, etc.</p>

<p>We read in the old account of J. Turnbull about the natives
of New South Wales, that all children who escape infanticide
are "nursed with an anxious affection, very creditable to
these savages. The infant no sooner begins to use his
limbs than he is instructed in throwing the spear; a bulrush
or other reed being put into his hand for this purpose."<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor" title="p. 100.">[698]</a></p>

<p>In his memoirs, Hodgson says that aboriginal children
are very kindly and tenderly treated by their parents.<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor" title="p. 244 (N. S. Wales).">[699]</a></p>

<p>The following statements, referring to New South Wales
blacks, give a good testimonial to their parental feelings.
"An old <em>mammy</em>, who was much about the farm of another
of my friends, was a perfect picture of maternal sorrow,"
after the death of her son. "If you spoke of her son, she was
dissolved in tears, and answered in whispers." "The women
appear to be always kind to their children, carrying the young
ones on their backs."<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor" title="Henderson, p. 121.">[700]</a></p>

<p>"They are remarkably fond of their children," says
R. Dawson. In another place the author speaks of a great
liberality towards children, displayed in distributing food.
He speaks also of the adoption of orphans. "When the parents
die, the children are adopted by the unmarried men and
women and taken the greatest care of"; and "children of
both sexes who had lost their parents were uniformly adopted
by those who had no families, and sometimes by those who
had."<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor" title="pp. 239, 268. Port Stephens blacks.">[701]</a></p>

<p>As a matter of illustration I may adduce what Dr. J. Fraser
says on that subject in his compilation on the New South Wales
tribes. The aborigines love their children and treat them
very kindly. The father makes for the boy a toy spear to
practise throwing it and the girl gets a small stick to learn
how to dig with it. The parents teach them to do all these
things, and they "take as much delight in this business as we
do in teaching our children their alphabet. The son is soon
<span class="pb" id="Pg243">[243]</span>
able to go out with his father on hunting expeditions," imbibes
all sorts of woodcraft and learns to know his tauri (hunting
district).<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor" title="pp. 4, 5, 60.">[702]</a> We may add that the book of Dr. Fraser, although
only a compilation, seems to be a very reliable one, and he
probably had much personal information from settlers,
missionaries, etc.</p>

<p>We have already seen from the first statement of Howitt
that parental love obtained among the Dieri. Gason affirms
that parental love for children and the love of these for their
parents is one of their greatest virtues.<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 258.">[703]</a> We read also that
"the children are never beaten, and should any woman
violate this law she is in turn beaten by her husband."<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[704]</a>
This statement would astonish us at first sight, as we usually
expect severity from the father. But when we remember
that the mother had probably all the drudgery and work
with the children we can understand that she might easily
lose her temper, and then the father took the children's
part. It is characteristic that the father's authority was
directed rather to protect the children from a probably
merited punishment than to punish and correct them.</p>

<p>Amongst the Urabunna, where, as we are informed, "individual
marriage does not exist either in name or in practice,"<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 63; repeated Nor. Tr., p. 73.">[705]</a> all children
of "men who are at the same level in the generation and
belong to the same class and totem are <em>regarded</em> as the common
children of these men." Still there exists "a closer tie between
a man and the children of the woman who habitually live in
camp with him."<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 64.">[706]</a> This statement is the only one which
tries to deny individual fatherhood and states the existence of
group fatherhood. But as we do not know what sense should
be given to the words "closer tie" and to the phrase "are regarded
as the common children" we must drop this statement as
quite meaningless. We know already that the relations of a
father to his child have several very characteristic features;
the father fondles his child; is especially attached to it; he
often carries it on the march (as these same authors state in
another place, see below); he has certain economic duties towards
his family; he lives in the same wurley with his children.
Not a single word is said about any of these things, and only
quite general assertions are made. We may repeat here,
with Mr. Thomas, that if the authors knew more concrete
facts about this question they ought to have communicated
them. If they told us everything they knew about the
subject, then their inferences are false. This statement
<span class="pb" id="Pg244">[244]</span>
loses its force for the reason especially that we know how
close the personal tie between the Dieri parents and their
children was, and that it was quite individual. And the
Dieri had the same Pirrauru institution which induces
Messrs. Spencer and Gillen to inform us that there was no
individual fatherhood or marriage, amongst the Urabunna.
There is, therefore, much reason to mistrust this statement.<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor" title="Compare what has been said about the Pirrauru and Piraungaru above, pp. 108 sqq.; especially p. 117, under 7.">[707]</a></p>

<p>Children are treated with extreme leniency among the
Central Australian tribes. "If the children are unruly the
mothers try to quiet them with fair words, or may scold
them a little, or even slap them gently, but never take any
extreme means." Mothers often quarrel and even fight with
each other defending their own offspring. "When a child
sickens, the mother takes it in her lap, and does not leave the
spot, the father sitting by."<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor" title="L. Schultze, loc. cit., p. 238 (Finke River natives).">[708]</a> All this shows a deep parental
affection towards the children. And that it is limited to
individual parents is confirmed by the following phrase:
"Orphans fare the worst, and usually the nearest relative
looks after them, but does not assume a parent's position.
Such children receive blows and have to provide for themselves
as best they can."<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 240.">[709]</a> Although I avoid the problem of
relationship terms, as lying outside the narrow limits of the
present study, that deals exclusively with facts of family
life, I quote the following statement of the same author
as especially instructive. "<i>Kata</i> signifies father of the
class; <i>Kata iltja</i> sexual father." The affix <i>iltja</i> indicates the
individual relationship and the affix <i>lirra</i> class reference.
"Ordinarily they leave out the words <i>iltja</i> and <i>lirra</i> and do
not use them, because they all know, among themselves, who
is personally related, and who is not. They are only used
casually when conversing with strangers, to whom they wish
to explain their family relationship."<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 237.">[710]</a></p>

<p>We read of the Arunta: "To their children they are, we
may say uniformly, with very rare exceptions, kind and
considerate, carrying them, the men as well as the women
taking part in this, when they get tired on the march, and
always seeing that they get a good share of any food."<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., pp. 50, 51.">[711]</a>
Here it is stated explicitly that the cares are shared by father
and mother. In another place the authors, speaking of the
burial ceremonies, say that the display of grief and sorrow
is not so much due to real feeling, as to tribal custom and fear
<span class="pb" id="Pg245">[245]</span>
of offending the dead one's spirit. And they add, "At the same
time, he (the native) is certainly capable of genuine grief and
of real affection for his children."<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 511.">[712]</a> The foregoing statement
appears to be very emphatic. Parental love is apparently
quoted as a genuine feeling conspicuous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> and
therefore to be opposed to any other more or less fictitious
display. The intimate connection between the mother and
her child appears also from some details in the initiation
ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 227, 250.">[713]</a></p>

<p>In the Kabi and Wakka tribes, "the wife was the
regular nurse of the infants, but the husband occasionally
took a turn."<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor" title="Mathew, loc. cit., p. 153.">[714]</a> "Children were over-indulged."<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 153.">[715]</a></p>

<p>"The mother is always fond of her child, and I have often
admired her patience with it. She constantly carries it with
her, at first in a basket, but later on ... on her shoulder.
Thus she carries it with her till it is several years old. If
the child cries she may perhaps get angry, but she will never
allow herself to strike it. The children are never chastised
either by the father or the mother." But they are nevertheless
as a rule "obliging and kind." "The black children
are not ... as bad as one might suppose, considering their
education, in which their wills are never resisted."<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor" title="Lumholtz, on the Herbert River Natives, loc. cit., pp. 192, 193.">[716]</a> "The
woman is often obliged to carry her little child on her shoulders

dig in the ground or climb trees."<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 160.">[717]</a> The mother, in one
instance, was much excited when a white man struck her
naughty child. The same author says that the tie between
mother and child is closer than that between father and child.
The children "are fonder of their mother than of their father."
(This seems quite "natural" to us as we observe it as a rule
in our society.) Sometimes the father cares much for his
child too; "he frequently carries it, takes it in his lap, searches
... its hair, plays with it, and makes little boomerangs,
which he teaches it to throw. He ... prefers boys to girls."
"Boys are not permitted to go hunting with their fathers
before they are nine years old."<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 193.">[718]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Georgina blacks the child's education is
carried on chiefly by the mother. She teaches the boys respect
for the tribal elders.<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor" title="Purcell in R.G.S., Victorian Branch, xi. pp. 19, 20.">[719]</a></p>

<p>Ph. Chauncy, speaking of the West Australian blacks,
says that love between children and parents was very strong,
and that it was one of the principal virtues of the aborigines.
He gives an example of a native who after five years, seeing
again his son, a grown-up lad, displayed a good deal of affection
and tenderness.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor" title="Br. Smyth, ii. p. 275.">[727]</a></p>

<p>Oldfield says: "Sometimes the love of their offspring
(male) is excessive." As an example he describes an old
man "who had a son, a lad of about nine years of age, of
whom he was excessively fond, always tenderly embracing
him and recommending him to the care of others when he
went on any expedition." When he returned from the
chase "he invariably first of all fondly kissed the boy before
proceeding to cook," and all the best parts of the meal
"were bestowed on the child." The child was consequently
quite spoilt and tyrannized over his father, who was quite
obedient to him.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 224, 225.">[729]</a></p>

I quote this statement <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i>, as it includes a good deal
of what we know in general of this subject. We see that
a mother might suckle two children at a time, but if it were
too difficult for her, the child is killed. Salvado speaks also of
adoption by another woman as an alternative (comp. above,
Dawson's and Shultze's statements); but adoption seems rather
to be an exceptional escape from infanticide.<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 275.">[731]</a> In another place,
the same author speaks of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"véritable tendresse maternelle"</span>
showing itself towards a child recently dead. Often did he
observe that a mother who had just lost a child would rise
in the night and go for miles through the woods, calling her
child by its name, speaking to it, and giving many tokens of
her tender feelings.<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 250.">[732]</a> This instance gives us a good insight
into a class of feelings that the general, popular mind would
hardly ascribe to savages.<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 274.">[733]</a> Salvado says that they make
a great difference between a boy and girl, in the joy which
they display at a child's birth. Not only the mothers (as we
saw above), but also the fathers show great fondness for their
children. Salvado blames the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"déférence des pères pour
les enfants."</span> Whatever a child might do, it is never chastised.
If a small boy wishes to obtain something from his
parents, he cries, bites and beats them, until he succeeds in
his purpose. The only punishment ever inflicted on their

The father prepares for his son small arms and teaches him
how to use them. He displays the greatest tenderness
towards him and is extremely fond of him.<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 276.">[734]</a> And the author
gives as the reason why the aborigines would not send their

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg248">[248]</span>
About the same tribes it is recorded: "Of their children they
appear to be fond, and rarely chastise them; but their treatment
of the women is not always gentle."<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor" title="Scott Nind, loc. cit., p. 37.">[738]</a> Here the difference
between the usual good treatment that children uniformly
enjoy from their parents, and the unsettled character
of marital treatment is clearly expressed.</p>

<p>Our best information on many points comes rather from
anecdotes and reports of real occurrences than from bare statements.
Some stories illustrate very well the present question.
So, for instance, the following, which proves beyond any
doubt that paternal affection among the Australian aborigines
might amount to a passion.<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor" title="Told by Curr, Recollections, ch. xxviii. 'Old Davie.'">[739]</a> Old Davie was a native of great
personal strength and skill, strong will, and great courage.
He was not especially clever, but was apparently kind to
children and to his wives. His inoffensive exterior, however,
hid a truly demoniac character; he was quite egotistical, "he
had never had any strong liking for anything else," but had
only one peculiar passion: "his special craving was for
murder." He had ever so many lives on his conscience.
When he grew old, he became the father of a rather nice
boy. He got deeply and passionately attached to his son,
called the Jumbuk-man. "To watch the gradual expansion
of Jumbuk-man's faculties; to see him balance himself
with his feet astride and throw his spear at his sister's
back; to observe him tomahawk the sleeping dogs, maltreat
any birds or insects he could lay hands on, bite his mother;
to hear him lisp foul words, and give himself up to the charming
ways of savage infancy, became henceforth the chief delight
of his father." Here we see a neat, condensed picture of
what might be called educational training under the father's
eyes. After a few years of life the boy died; the death of
the boy was a terrible blow "to Old Davie. He had been his
special delight ... and (he) bore his loss in a very unstoical
way. He sat on the ground, streams of tears
welling from his eyes." The end of the story (Old Davie's
murder of a young woman in revenge for "sorcery" done by
her tribe) does not touch our subject.</p>

<p>As an interesting and good illustration of parental authority
may be adduced the story of how a Bangerang girl was
made to join her promised husband. She was, apparently,
quite unwilling to do it; consequently her father tried to
persuade her. After his patience had been exhausted he
tried to compel her; having at last resource to his club. This
and the unanimous and rather strong persuasions of both
<span class="pb" id="Pg249">[249]</span>
parents made her follow the prescribed course.<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, Recollections, pp. 141-145.">[740]</a> This story
shows that the father had not a great amount of authority
over his daughter. He had to persuade her for several
hours and she brought him by her stubbornness to a fit of
anger, which finally settled the matter.</p>

<p>Another story clearly exemplifying paternal affection, is
told by Grey.<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., ii. pp. 350-361 (refers to natives of King George's Sound).">[741]</a> For some small trespass Capt. Grey got hold
of a young boy, the son of an influential native. The father
tried to liberate him. "The natives are always ardently
attached to their children, and this the boy's father now
evinced in the strongest manner. He tried by persuasion,
begging and even threats to induce the white man to give
him back his child. He fairly wept upon his child's neck."
When this had no result, and the boy was imprisoned, he
made all possible efforts to plead for him. The paternal
love is clearly conspicuous in the whole tale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our forty-one statements agree fairly well on many
points, but especially on the principal question, namely
on the existence of very close personal and individual
bonds of union between parents and children.<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor" title="An exception may be seen in the statement of Spencer and Gillen on the Urabunna, as far as it seems to point to a group relationship, but there are reasons for not attaching too much importance to this statement. We dealt also above (p. 117) with the question whether there is group relationship between parents and children in the tribes where the Pirrauru custom prevails, and it was found that the assumption of its existence must be absolutely discarded, ...">[742]</a> As so
much stress has been laid on the emotional element in
these bonds, it may be shown now how far the evidence
confirms the views expressed above.<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor" title="pp. 191 sqq.">[743]</a> Speaking in concrete
terms, the evidence affirms beyond any doubt the
existence of strong feelings of affection and attachment
between parents and children. Thirty-five of our forty-one
statements explicitly affirm the existence of such
feelings. In many places this is expressed in a very clear
and emphatic manner. We read that the children are the
"pride and love" of their parents; that affection for
<span class="pb" id="Pg250">[250]</span>
their children is a "marked feature" of the aboriginal
character (Howitt). Deep affection is quoted as their
chief virtue (Gason); and as the most sincere and strongest
feeling (Spencer and Gillen); and so forth. Instances
might easily be multiplied. The only negative instance
is the completely unreliable statement of Wilkes. This
exceptional agreement of all authors and the uniform
emphasis that they lay upon their statements is in itself
a very strong proof not only that this assertion is true,
but that these facts strongly impressed themselves upon
the observers.<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor" title="Compare above, pp. 193, 194.">[744]</a> On this point our best authorities entirely
agree with the remaining observers. Such an agreement
on the point of a general judgment, which is necessarily
an induction from a considerable number of observations,
can only mean that the latter were not liable to misinterpretation;
that they plainly expressed their deeper
psychological meaning. These observations seem at
first sight very difficult to be made correctly, for they
are of a rather subtle character, referring to impalpable
psychological facts. And yet all authors interpreted
them correctly, of which fact such an agreement is the
best proof. The expression of the feelings in question
amongst savages must obviously differ very little from
our ways of showing feelings. The complete agreement
of the statements points, therefore, to the unmistakable
clearness and strength in which the native feelings show
themselves, in all the details of family life as well as in
some more important facts.<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor" title="Compare the passages above, pp. 195, 196.">[745]</a></p>

<p>But even if unwilling to trust to the emphasis of our
informants' general affirmations and to the agreement
between them, we find many concrete details and examples,
mentioned by the authors, which convince us
that the conclusions they have drawn from observation
were correct. Howitt says that to secure the good-will of
the parents the most direct way is to admire their children;
a fact which is characteristic of parental infatuation in our
<span class="pb" id="Pg251">[251]</span>
own society. When the children are ill the parents watch
over and look after them most carefully (Schultze, Salvado,
Meyer, Howitt); they make toys for their children
(Mitchell, Curr, Fraser); and they look very carefully
after their food (Spencer and Gillen, Dawson). On
the death of a child the parents display great sorrow
(Browne, Henderson, Curr in the story of old Davie).<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor" title="Compare also the examples referred to in foregoing footnote.">[746]</a> And
the horrid custom of carrying a dead babe on their wanderings
is also a token of deep affection (Angas, Bennett,
Howitt). After long absence the parents display great
joy and tenderness (Chauncy). And although adoption
is reported in some tribes (R. Dawson, Schultze, Salvado),
nevertheless there is not always the same degree of love
and affection towards adopted children as towards the
offspring. And the former are often illtreated (Schultze).
Such examples could easily be multiplied. And they show
in how many quite unmistakable facts the main features
of the parental feelings for children found their expression.
These feelings as a rule consisted of love, pride, affection
and attachment.</p>

<p>All this seems to hold good for the father, as well as for
the mother. In the majority of statements both the
parents are mentioned indiscriminately. Some of them
say expressly that they refer to the father also (Meyer,
Wilhelmi, Moore Davis, Br. Smyth, Fraser, Gason,
Mathew, Spencer and Gillen, Mrs. Parker, Salvado).
Nevertheless we must assume that owing to the closer
tie in daily life the relationship between mother and
child was a yet more intimate one (Lumholtz, Salvado).
There seems to have been but little difference made
between male and female children. We read in a few
places (Schürmann, Spencer and Gillen) that boys were
more welcome than girls, and that infanticide was more
frequently carried out amongst the latter. But this is contradicted
elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., pp. 748-750.">[747]</a> where we read that in several tribes no
difference in infanticide was made between boys and girls.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg252">[252]</span>
Parallel with great affection towards the children ran
considerable leniency of treatment. In about eighteen
of our statements (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> in all of those in which there is
anything said about treatment besides affection) we read
that the natives treat their children with kindness, absolute
leniency and indulgence, never chastise them, and
give them their own way in everything. It is well to
notice that these two things&mdash;real love on the one hand and
leniency of treatment on the other&mdash;must be treated as
two independent phenomena. Affection may be perfectly
well combined with severity and rigour; and a want of
punishment need not be necessarily based upon love; it
may result just as well from carelessness. But this latter
does not seem to be the case; we know that the parents
are not careless about their children; that on the contrary
they take the greatest trouble about them and look carefully
after all the necessities of their life. Here the
leniency of treatment seems to be exclusively due to
excessive fondness for their children and the resulting
weakness shown towards them. In other societies the
reason of the same phenomenon is often (especially in
the case of male children) the wish not to frighten the boy
and not to make him a coward, in which belief magical
elements may also play a rôle. (Compare Steinmetz, article
in <cite>Z.f.S.</cite> i.) A suggestion of such a reason is contained in
only one of our statements (Roth in <cite>Trans. R.S.Q.</cite>) In
general it may be said that the way in which the aborigines
treat their children is a symptom of their great parental
love.<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor" title="Compare also the general reason given by Steinmetz for the prevalence of this indulgence among savage peoples. Zeitschr. für Sozialwissenschaft, Band i. pp. 254-285.">[748]</a> Only in two places (Spencer and Gillen, Lumholtz)
is it said that in fits of anger and impatience the natives
chastise their children, and even this seems to be quite
exceptional. Very interesting is Gason's statement, according
to which it seems that the father was even more
lenient than the mother; and this seems quite natural,
for the mother had much more opportunity to get angry
with the child.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg253">[253]</span>
It is characteristic that even those authors who write
in strong terms of the bad treatment which the husband
shows towards his wife (compare the statements above)
say nothing of the kind as to the treatment of the children
by their fathers. On the contrary, we read in several
places of the tyranny of the young boy, under which often
his mother and sisters and sometimes even his father had
to suffer (Curr in several places, especially in the story of
Old Davie; J. Moore Davies, Oldfield, Salvado). But
two other writers (Lumholtz and Bonney) inform us that
in spite of the entire lack of severity the children are
not naughty at all, as might have been expected.</p>

<p>It may be safely concluded that the evidence gives a
quite true picture of the parental feelings. The latter
may be considered as elements which essentially characterize
the relation of parents to children. And it may be
said that in Australia the parents are most devoted and
loving to their children. The importance of this conclusion
in regard to our ideas of parental kinship in
Australia has been argued sufficiently above.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor" title="See pp. 191 sqq.">[749]</a></p>

<p>The facts stated in this conclusion seem to have an
important bearing upon the relation between husband
and wife. This point is completely ignored by the first-hand
observers, who never troubled to inquire deeper
into the mutual dependence of such most important
sociological facts, viz. of the relationship between parents
and children on the one hand and between husband
and wife on the other. There are no statements on this
point, and consequently one is obliged to draw the inference
for oneself. But the bearing of the parental
relationship upon the conjugal relations is so obvious
and the mutual dependence of marriage and family so
clear, that the following inference seems not at all hypothetical
and arbitrary. If both parents are strongly
attached to their children, if their feelings are so outspoken,
these must constitute a strong binding tie between
them. It is hardly possible to think that a man could be
<span class="pb" id="Pg254">[254]</span>
merely a brutal master and tyrant to his wife if they both
had the same feelings for the same object. But it is still
less possible to admit that a man and a woman would on
the first occasion, or even without any reason, part and
form new unions if they were both attached so strongly
to the same person&mdash;an attachment which, as in so many
examples, sometimes amounted to a real passion.</p>

<p>Turning to the other question, to be answered from our
evidence&mdash;the question of paternal authority or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas</i>&mdash;let
us first fix the meaning of the word. To the word
authority (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas</i>) a legal sense can be given. Then it
expresses the sum of the rights that legally are allotted
to the father over his children. So in Rome <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas</i>
meant the absolute power of life, death and liberty that
the father legally possessed over the persons of his children.<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor" title="Compare also the discussions above, pp. 185 sqq.">[750]</a>
Every legal relation presupposes a possibility of interference
or enforcement on the part of some social authority,
and it assumes a set of fixed norms sanctioned in some
way by society. Now we do not possess any knowledge
of any such possibility in the case of the parental relationship,
or of any norms that are laid down in any form by
the Australian aboriginal society for the said relationship.
The terms <em>authority</em> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas</i>, therefore, cannot be used
in their strict sense or indeed in any sense at all if we imply
a <em>legal meaning</em> to them. We are more justified in applying
them to the Australian natives, if we use them as
an expression of the mere fact that the father could
do anything he liked with his children, that he had
an absolute power over them. But even here we should
be careful in ascribing the exclusive power to the
father. In the only cases where the question of a
decision as to the child's lot arises, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> in the cases
of infanticide and giving the girl away in marriage,
there are contradictory instances ascribing the power
of decision to some one else. So, for instance, in the
Mukjarawaint tribe the father was not allowed to decide
whether his child was to be killed or not at birth; it was
<span class="pb" id="Pg255">[255]</span>
the grandparents' affair. Curr affirms, on the other hand,
that infanticide depended exclusively upon the father.
In some tribes it was not the father's privilege to give
his daughter in marriage. Nevertheless, as was shown
above in <a href="#Pg34">Chapter II</a>, as a rule it was the father who
disposed of his daughter.</p>

<p>Although our information on these points is scanty,
these few hints seem to prove that there were some infringements
of the father's liberty from outside. How
far they were <em>legal</em> is difficult to ascertain. At any rate
we see that the father's authority was rather limited by
legal factors than enhanced. But even if this be an
exceptional instance, and if as a rule nobody could interfere
with the father in whatever he was pleased to do with
his children&mdash;a supposition which seems fairly to agree
with the general authority of the husband and the isolation
of families&mdash;it must still be remembered that the father
as a matter of fact never made use of his unrestricted
authority. In the first place, as will be plainly shown
below, the father's contact with and exclusive influence
over his children ceased at the moment they reached
puberty. Our question is therefore limited to the period
before reaching puberty (in the boys perhaps even sooner,
from about seven to ten years; see below), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo ipso</i>
loses a great deal of its contents. A small child living
with its parents alone in the wilderness is naturally
entirely in their hands and at their mercy. But it would
be a fallacy to lay any stress on that point. As our
statements show, the child is protected against any ill-treatment,
or even against any severity from either of its
parents, by their own feelings much better than it could
be by any legal measures. And the fact remains that
the father's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas</i> or authority (or whatever any kind
of coercive power may be called) is by no means a characteristic
feature of his relation to his children, for according
to aboriginal custom and psychology, any element of that
kind is absolutely absent from their family life.</p>

<p>In other words we may say that our information on the
<span class="pb" id="Pg256">[256]</span>
regulation of paternal authority in the few cases where it
can come into play is very scanty. Probably there are
no rules, or only a few,<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor" title="As mentioned above it is impossible to say how far such rules are legal, i. e. laid down and enforced by society.">[751]</a> and the father is more or less free
to dispose of his child. But I mentioned some contradictory
instances, and I would not lay any stress on that
assertion. What appears to be quite clear is that paternal
authority does not play any important part in family life;
for the parental relation is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> of love, and not of
coercion. And considering that we know very little
about the father's authority and only feel sure that it is
insignificant, it cannot be reasonably chosen as a determining
factor of the paternal relation.</p>

<p>From the lack of any chastisement we may infer that
the education given by the parents to their children was a
very insignificant one, for it is impossible to conceive of
any serious education without coercive treatment, especially
at that low stage of culture. But as the children are
continually with their mother and very often with their
father, the parental influence must be of great importance
in the questions of the arts of life and of all the knowledge
necessary in tribal affairs. We read in several places of
the control and educative influence exercised by the
mother on her children (Kurnai, Euahlayi, Georgina
Blacks, Herbert River tribes, North-West Australian tribes
according to Withnell, Salvado). The father makes toys
for his children and teaches the boys how to throw the
spear, use the boomerang, and so on (Curr on Australians
in general; Encounter Bay; Turnbull; Salvado; compare
also Dr. Fraser's statement).</p>

<p>Here it must be remembered that education depends
still more on another set of facts, namely on the facts of
initiation and the secret society formed by all initiated
men. The boy's education begins with the moment
when he leaves his parents, joins the young men's camp,
and begins to undergo a series of initiations. At any
rate he begins then to be educated in quite a new order of
<span class="pb" id="Pg257">[257]</span>
ideas, initiated into the tribal mysteries, etc. And apparently
he has then to submit to a severe <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, besides
going through the ordeal of initiation itself. It seems,
therefore, that the education received by the children
in their parents' camp, where they are probably more
under the influence of their mother and perhaps of other
women who happen to be in the same encampment, that
this education is definitive only for the females, who can
learn from their mothers all they will want in their future
life. For the boys this first education is of secondary
importance. All they have learned of the tribal traditions
and beliefs&mdash;their whole knowledge of the world&mdash;is
destroyed at the initiation and replaced by a new one.
We see, therefore, that the relations between parents and
children are limited to a relatively short period; for the
girls marry at about ten years of age, and the boys at the
same age leave their parental camp and begin a new life.
These facts are so important, as characterizing the aboriginal
family life, that we must dwell upon them more in
detail.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The relation of children to their parents undergoes an
essential change at the time when the former arrive at
puberty. At this time they are removed from their
parents' immediate presence and control. The girls
marry very early, that is they are very early removed
from their parents' camp to that of their husband. Boys
have to undergo the initiation ceremonies at about the age
when the girls marry, and according to all we know never
return any more to their parents' camp. The fact of the
early marriage of Australian aboriginal females is well
known. The age at which it takes place is stated to be
from eight to fourteen years of age; but generally the
age of about ten to twelve is alleged.<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor" title="Curr states it to vary from eight to fourteen, at various places: Recollections, pp. 50, 129, A.R., i. p. 107; Meyer in Woods, p. 190, states it to be from ten to twelve; Schürmann in Woods, p. 222, at arriving at puberty; Fraser, p. 2, at a very young age; Eyre, ii. p. 319, at about twelve years of age; Br. myth, i. p. 77, very early; Spencer and Gillen at from fourteen to fifteen years of age (Nat. Tr., p. 92 and Nor. Tr., p. 134); Withnell, p. 8, at about twelve years of age; ...">[752]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg258">[258]</span>
Very important is also the point which Curr emphasizes,
viz. that no girl above about sixteen or widow under
about forty-five is left unmarried.<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, Recollections, p. 129.">[753]</a> So that, according to
this statement, practically all women who are marriageable
would be married. But this is perhaps in contradiction
to a couple of statements we shall meet below, which
affirm the existence of a camp of unmarried females. So
that this point seems to present some ambiguity. At
any rate it seems quite certain that unmarried females
are not left long in this state.</p>

<p>We know very little as to how far the relations between a
girl and her parents cease when she leaves them. Marriage
seems to be as a general rule patrilocal; the wife leaves
her parents' camp and removes to her husband's. The
only exception to this rule will be quoted below (see <a href="#Pg266">p. 266</a>).
With that, a great part of the parents' influence and
contact seem to be necessarily interrupted; for we saw
in the discussion on the mode of living that the families
camp either separately or in very small groups. And
therefore a wife living in her husband's camp would
probably not live in the same local group with her parents.
And in some cases, where as in the Bangerang the local
divisions seem to have been more numerous, or as in the
Kurnai the population seems to have been more dense
(the local groups living nearer each other), local exogamy
prevailed and the girl naturally went away.<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor" title="Such local exogamy prevailed also in some of the North Central tribes, viz. in the Warramunga nation, owing to the local segregation of the two moieties. There the girl must always marry far away from her natal place. Compare Nor. Tr., pp. 28-30.">[754]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the mother-in-law taboo obtained well-nigh
in all tribes, so that the husband was cut off from contact
<span class="pb" id="Pg259">[259]</span>
with his parents-in-law; therefore his wife was to some
extent also handicapped in her relations with them.
That when the married couple were in the same local
group with the wife's parents there were some binding
elements and forms of close intercourse between both
parties appears in the description given below of the
economics of the household. But in all probability the
authority of the parents over the girl and the real intimacy
of their relations ceased at the moment she was given
over to her husband.<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor" title="Grey, ii. pp. 229, 231, and Parkhouse, A.A.A.S., vi. p. 641.">[755]</a></p>

<p>There is another point connected with marriage and
age. We saw that girls marry very early, at the age of
about twelve years. The men on the other side do not
marry so early. We do not possess very copious information
on this point. It is certain that boys were not
allowed to marry before they passed the initiation ceremonies.
Now these began at puberty, and were extended
probably over several years. So it appears, at least,
from all the more exact and detailed descriptions we
possess of these ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor" title="Compare the description of initiation ceremonies in the works of Spencer and Gillen, Howitt, Roth, and Mathew.">[756]</a> And it seems that the males
had to pass through a whole series of ceremonies before
they were allowed to marry. We read in Salvado (p. 277)
that it was a crime, severely punished, often by death, for
a man to marry below the age of thirty. And he adds
that they had a marvellous skill in ascertaining age by
means of a series of ceremonies through which every male
had to pass. The same is stated by Curr (<cite>A.R.</cite>, i. p. 107),
viz. that the men seldom marry under thirty. According
to some statements from the South-Eastern area boys
appear to be allowed to marry younger.</p>

<p>From these few data it appears that males married much
later and that consequently there must have been some
disparity of age. But this disparity was much greater,
owing to the circumstance that the young girls were as a
rule allotted to old men, and the boys whenever they were
<span class="pb" id="Pg260">[260]</span>
allowed to marry got old <i>lubras</i> as wives. We have a
whole series of statements affirming this and reporting
the difference of age to be usually about thirty years, if
the female was younger; and at any rate stating that
there was seldom a couple in which both partners were
young. These statements refer to tribes scattered all over
the continent, so that disparity of age in marriage seems
to be quite a universal feature in Australia.</p>

<p>We may point to the circumstance that this disparity
of age stands in connection with the very prevalent
form of betrothal, viz. the promising of a girl in
infancy usually to a mature man. Other modes of obtaining
wives, as exchange of a daughter for a wife, and
levirate, stand also in connection with the disparity of
age.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Statements.</i>&mdash;We read in Curr: "The Australian male almost
invariably obtains his wife or wives either as a survivor of a
married brother, or in exchange for his sisters, or later on in life
for his daughters." An old widow often falls to the lot of some
young bachelor.<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, A.R., i. p. 107. This is said about the Australians in general.">[757]</a> On the other hand young girls are allotted
to old men. "One often sees a child of eight the wife of a
man of fifty." And we read further: "The marriage rules
of the blacks result in very ill-assorted unions as regards
age; for it is usual to see old men with mere girls as wives
and men in the prime of life married to old widows. As a
rule women are not obtained by the men unless they are at
least thirty years of age. Women have very frequently two
husbands during their lifetime, the first older and the second
younger than themselves."<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 110.">[758]</a> "I never heard of a female
over sixteen years of age, who, prior to the breakdown of
aboriginal customs after the coming of the Whites, had not
a husband."<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[759]</a></p>

<p>Speaking again on marriage among the Bangerang, Curr
says: "As a rule, girls would be about twelve or fourteen
years of age, and their husbands-elect some five-and-thirty
years older, and already the lords of one or two spouses."
"In this way it happened that one seldom saw a couple in
which both the parties were young."<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor" title="Recollections, p. 129.">[760]</a> And further on we
read, "Few men under thirty have lubras." But in the age
<span class="pb" id="Pg261">[261]</span>
between fifty and sixty men usually possess two or three
wives. The difference between the spouses is usually twenty
years; sometimes much more.<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor" title="Recollections, p. 171.">[761]</a></p>

<p>We find the disparity of age in marriage mentioned by
Howitt in several places. So we learn that old men were
often betrothed to young girls among the Wolgal.<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 197.">[762]</a> We
read that in Australia old men secure the young females
for themselves.<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., p. 354.">[763]</a> And that young men obtain for wives some
old repudiated wife of one of the old men.<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor" title="Trans. R.S.V. (1888), p. 126.">[764]</a> Among the
Geawe Gal "girls were affianced to men much older than
themselves."<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., p. 280.">[765]</a> Speaking of the Dieri and other South Central
tribes he says that old wives of old men are handed over to
young boys.<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor" title="J.A.I., xx. p. 55.">[766]</a></p>

<p>Howitt informs us also that no man might marry before
duly initiated; and then the old men of the tribe had to give
their consent.<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor" title="Trans. R.S.V., p. 116.">[767]</a> Obviously, therefore, the age at which men
could get married was much later than that in which females
were given away.</p>

<p>Eyre found in the tribes with which he was in contact
that women of between thirty and forty years of age were often
cast off and given to young boys.<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., ii. p. 322.">[768]</a> Young girls were often
allotted to old men.<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 319.">[769]</a></p>

<p>Disparity of age is stated also by Angas. Old men get
often the youngest and comeliest women; whilst the old and
haggard females were left for the young men.<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., i. p. 82 (Murray River tribes).">[770]</a></p>

<p>Among the Encounter Bay tribes the girls "are given in
marriage at a very early age (ten or twelve years)." And as
it is very often the father who exchanges his daughter for a
wife, it is evident that a great disparity of age must
prevail.<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor" title="Meyer in Woods, p. 190.">[771]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Parker says that among the Euahlayi baby girls were
often betrothed to "some old chap" who might have even
already as many as two or three wives.<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 55.">[772]</a> Whereas quite a
young man was often allotted to an old woman. Age is not
a disqualification for a woman to marry.<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 56.">[773]</a></p>

<p>In the Central tribes, owing to the Tualcha Mura institution,<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor" title="See above, p. 41.">[774]</a>
"men very frequently have wives much younger than themselves,
as the husband and the mother of a wife obtained in
this way are usually of approximately the same age."<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 558.">[775]</a> And
<span class="pb" id="Pg262">[262]</span>
it may be remembered that this is the "most usual method
of obtaining a wife."<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 558.">[776]</a></p>

<p>We are informed that among the tribes near Victoria
River Downs<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor" title="Northern Territory, South Australia, J.A.I., xxiv. p. 181. In the answers to the Questions of Prof. Frazer.">[777]</a> a man may marry at about thirty years of
age, and the older he grows the younger girls he gets. Girls
are married on reaching puberty; and usually to old men;
whereas young men often receive old women.</p>

<p>In the Kabi and Wakka tribes "the elder men had sometimes
a plurality of wives, while the young men had for a
long time after reaching manhood to remain, perforce, single.
I never knew a man to have more than two wives at the one
time, and generally one sufficed. There was no minimum of
age for the marriage of girls, and so it occasionally happened
that a child of twelve became the wife of a man of sixty.
I knew a case in point."<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor" title="Mathew, p. 162. Compare also Lumholtz, loc. cit., p. 192.">[778]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>As we have mentioned above, boys leave their parents'
camp to undergo the initiation ceremonies. These latter
seem to obtain in all tribes, with a few insignificant exceptions
such as the Bidwelli mentioned by Howitt.
This is a quite well-known fact. But what is their mode
of living during this, in some tribes, rather prolonged period
and afterwards, before they marry? They do not live
in their parents' camp; and they have not yet their
individual settlement. They appear in the great majority
of cases to club together, have their own encampment,
roam and hunt on their own account, and in general to
live a life apart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Statements.</i>&mdash;Howitt, speaking of the camping rules among
the Kurnai, says that a "'brogan' (a man initiated at the

men and for the single females respectively."<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor" title="Schultze, loc. cit., p. 230.">[805]</a> The same
author reports that the natives are fond of visits. "The
meeting-place is usually the Tmara-nkanja for the men, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i>
the bachelors' camp."<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 234.">[806]</a></p>

<p>In the Arunta tribe the boys "go out with the women as
they searched for vegetable food and the smaller animals,"
up to the first initiation ceremony. Afterwards "they begin
to accompany the men in their search for larger" game.
At this first initiation they change also their mode of living;
"in the future they must not play with the women
and girls, nor must they camp with them as they have
hitherto done, but henceforth they must go to the camp of
the men, which is known as the Ungunja."<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., pp. 215, 216.">[807]</a> Among the
Arunta there is a "special part of the main camp where the
men assemble and near to which the women may not go."<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor" title="See index, p. 656; the Ungunja is mentioned several times in the text, p. 557 and passim.">[808]</a>
It must exist only when a greater number of natives are
assembled,<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor" title="See Chap. V.">[809]</a> for normally the people roam scattered over the
country. But during these latter periods the unmarried
men lead probably an existence of their own, as they cannot
live with families (compare above <a href="#Pg132">mode of living</a>). This
information about the bachelors' camp in the Arunta is not
quite clear, as we see. But all we read points to its existence.</p>

<p>We find the bachelors' camp (Lagerplatz der jungen Männer;
tmarankintja) mentioned by the Rev. E. Strehlow, in connection
with the totemic ceremonies amongst the Arunta.<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor" title="Part iii. p. 7 and passim.">[810]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg266">[266]</span>
We read about the tribes near Port Darwin: "Children
live with their parents until puberty, when girls become
members of their husband's households, residing sometimes
with him, and at other times at the parental camp."<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor" title="T. A. Parkhouse, loc. cit., p. 641.">[811]</a> I
may add here, that this is the only example where matrilocal
marriage is mentioned in Australia. Everywhere else
we find it stated that the girl removes to her husband's camp.<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor" title="Compare N. W. Thomas, loc. cit., p. 16.">[812]</a>
We read farther that the boys are taken, after their initiation,
"in charge by those whose duty it is to train" them. "They
lived in a large wurley, which would accommodate all the boys.
As a fact ... no boys between seventeen and nineteen are
seen at Port Darwin."<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 643.">[813]</a> Here we are told that there was
one big hut in which all the boys lived; but this seems rather
to be an exception.</p>

<p>Roth says that children of about seven years of age leave
their parents' camp and go to stay with their grandparents.<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor" title="Eth. Stud., p. 183.">[814]</a>
We are not informed whether there exists a bachelors' camp
in the North-West Central Queensland tribes; but this
statement does not deny it, for boys are apparently not at
once initiated after leaving their parental camp. Another
statement of the same author about the natives of Koombana
Bay (Queensland), affirms it explicitly: "The younger
single males at a certain stage (puberty and onwards) always
had a fire to themselves."<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor" title="Proc. R.S.Q., p. 48.">[815]</a> And again: "The grown-up
lads sleep together, apart from the others."<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 51.">[816]</a></p>

<p>Grey says that strangers visiting a tribe, if unmarried or
without their wives, "sleep at the fire of the young men."<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor" title="Grey, ii. p. 252.">[817]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Salvado, according to whose information the
South-West Australian natives live in small tribes of six
to nine persons, says that when a family disposes itself to
sleep <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"les garçons qui out passé l'âge de sept ans dorment
seuls autour du feu commun."</span><a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor" title="p. 280.">[818]</a></p>

<p>It is stated in two statements above (Dawson and Schultze),
that there were camps of unmarried females as well as of
single men. We may add here two other statements about such
camps.<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., pp. 232, 233.">[819]</a> In the Maryborough tribes there were camps of
unmarried girls, in connection with which there was some
sexual licence. Similarly in the North-West Central Queensland
tribes,<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor" title="N. Q. Eth. Bull. 8, p. 6.">[820]</a> studied by Roth, single girls lived in groups,
under the control of an old man. Such phenomena would
account for the licence of unmarried females, which we
<span class="pb" id="Pg267">[267]</span>
find sometimes reported. But they do not seem to have a
very large extension in the Australian aboriginal society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We see in the first place from this evidence<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor" title="We have collected here twenty-two statements in which there are many more tribes included.">[821]</a> that boys
were actually removed from their parents' care and that
they acquired a complete independence of their parents
on reaching puberty. This is especially mentioned in
several of our statements (Kurnai, Bangerang, Lower
Murray River tribes, Encounter Bay tribes, Port Darwin
tribes). It appears also to result <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> from the
circumstance that the boys lived in quite a different
part of the encampment, and so could not be under the
control of their parents. It appears from Curr's and
Parkhouse's statements that they even lived in a separate
locality. And confronting our evidence concerning the
bachelors' camp with what we know about the aboriginal
mode of living, it appears also highly probable that if the
boys' camp numbered from six to eight inmates (compare
Eyre's statement) they must have roamed about in a
separate group. We read that in two cases the boys
joined their grandparents (Howitt about the Mukjarawaint
tribe and Roth). Only the statement of Dawson
suggests that boys remained with their parents, and even
that, as we saw, does not follow very clearly from this
statement.</p>

<p>We are informed in several places about the mode of
living of the lads in their separate camp. They seem to
have partly provided their own food and cooked it (Curr).
They slept in one big hut (Parkhouse) or round a common
fire (Salvado and others). In general they seem to have
formed a distinct, separate social unit. This time, spent
in the bachelors' camp, was the real time of training (see
Curr's statement. Compare Hutton Webster, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>,
chap. iv. pp. 49-51). They came under the influence
of a new authority&mdash;the authority of the tribal elders.
And, especially during the actual time of initiation, all the
<span class="pb" id="Pg268">[268]</span>
wisdom and morality they had to learn was imparted to
the young people by the old men of the tribe. Probably
there also they formed new acquaintances and relationships
besides the family ones in which they were
brought up. The institution of bachelors' camp is
general among all the Australian tribes. Our evidence
is not detailed enough to allow us to trace geographical
differences in any particular feature. We may mention
here, by the way, that the bachelors' camp of Australia
was a form of the widespread institution of the men's-house.<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor" title="In this connection the bachelors' camp in Australia is mentioned by Hutton Webster (amongst the Kurnai, Euahlayi, Arunta and Port Darwin tribes). The author speaks of it as a symptom of the general principle of separation of sexes. Primitive Secret Societies, pp. 1, 3.">[822]</a></p>

<p>In sum, all these factors give great weight to the facts
here discussed; viz. to those of the early marriage of
girls and the initiation of boys. We see that these facts
take away from the Australian family its patriarchal
character. The father's authority is exercised over
his children merely during their early childhood, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i>
during a period when there is in a general way very little
room for the display of any serious authority. Still more,
as there was no serious and real training during this time,
all education, as far as it was given at all by the father,
assumed more the form of play, as we saw above (<a href="#Pg256">p. 256</a>);
and, as we saw, during that period great leniency towards
the offspring was the chief feature of the father's behaviour.<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor" title="On these connections in general compare the interesting article of Steinmetz, Zeitschrift f. Sozialw., II, pp. 613, 614.">[823]</a>
When a serious and often harsh training took
place, it was not the father's individual authority that
enforced it, but the tribal elders'. So we see that our
former result is hereby confirmed, viz. that there is no
foundation for designing the father's relation to his child as
based upon authority or any idea of proprietorship. That
applies to a girl as well as to a boy. But in the case
of the former we might attribute some meaning to the
<span class="pb" id="Pg269">[269]</span>
word property, although it would be rather straining the
sense of the word.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was seen that on reaching a certain age the children
leave their parents' camp and are removed from their
control; still the personal, individual bond of kinship is
not broken. And although it does not find its expression
in facts of daily life, for the children and the parents live
apart, yet there are some facts which unmistakably
reveal the existence of a strong lifelong affection and
attachment between parents and children.</p>

<p>These facts are: real sorrow displayed at the death
or funeral of a near relative, and especially that displayed
by parents at the death of their children; joy and tenderness
shown to children whenever met for the first time
after a long absence. Here also must be placed the
numerous occurrences in which love was displayed for
white men who were recognized as dead relatives.
In these cases their supposed parents always displayed
the greatest amount of tenderness towards them, and
often underwent considerable sacrifices for the sake of
helping or even seeing their "children." The close connection
between grandchildren and grandparents shows
also that there was a near individual tie between the
parents of the children and their parents. Let us
adduce some statements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Statements.</i>&mdash;Curr remarks shortly but clearly: "Parental
affection always endured," after the children left their parents
and became practically independent of them.<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor" title="Recollections, p. 248.">[824]</a></p>

<p>A story showing strong filial attachment is told by R.
Dawson. Relating an anecdote, he concludes: "The manner in
which Youee told the story was exceedingly interesting; his
lamentations, that 'white pellow' should treat his father
so, and the mild complaining tone in which they were made,
thoroughly portrayed his filial attachment to his father, of
<span class="pb" id="Pg270">[270]</span>
whom he said several times, turning to him with a tone and
manner that could not be mistaken, '<em>Murry</em> good wool
man! <em>Murry</em> good wool man, massa.'"<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor" title="R. Dawson, loc. cit., p. 312. Pt. Stephens tribes.">[825]</a></p>

<p>A characteristic story, proving paternal affection, is told
by Bonney. An old man was once cut with a tomahawk by
his son, a big, strong man who had fits of madness. "The
old man returned to the camp and with tears in his eyes told
me what had happened, and begged me to assist him to bring
back his mad son before he had perished in the bush."<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor" title="Bonney, J.A.I., xiii. p. 135. Riv. Darling tribe.">[826]</a></p>

<p>We have also a few statements about the relations between
grandparents and grandchildren. We are informed that
among the Mukjarawaint the grandparents had the exclusive
right to decide whether the child should be killed directly
after birth or allowed to live. In the former case the grandparents
had the privilege of eating the child.<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., pp. 243, 749.">[827]</a> We read of
the important rôle the grandmother played in the North
Queensland tribes at the naming of the child,<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor" title="Roth, Bull. V. p. 8.">[828]</a> and amongst
the Euahlayi at the Betrothal Ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor" title="Mrs. Parker, loc. cit., p. 51. Comp. above, p. 40.">[829]</a> Amongst the
Kurnai also "the name is given by the paternal grandfather
or grandmother, or in default by the mother's parents."<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Kam. and Kurn., pp. 190, 191.">[830]</a></p>

<p>A series of interesting instances is told by Fraser. He says,
"Their natural affections are keen; in proof of this I need
only refer to their grief over a dead relative, even though it
be a very young child; they utter loud lamentations and cut
and burn the flesh of their bodies in grief. This expression
of grief is not all artificial or professional like the hired
'ululatus' of the Romans or the 'keening' of the Irish.
That it is genuine on the part of the near relatives of the
deceased I can prove by examples. Jackey, the 'king' of
the Gresford blacks, died and was buried; his mother could
not be induced to leave the spot; she sat there night and
day, refusing food, until one morning she was found dead on
his grave. She was buried beside her son."<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor" title="J. Fraser, loc. cit., p. 44.">[831]</a>&mdash;"A woman of
the Dungog tribule had a child which was hunch-backed and
otherwise deformed; she carried it on her back for eighteen or
nineteen years; it seemed always no bigger than a child of
six or seven years. Her husband also carried about, for two
or three years, a son whose feet from the ankles had been
destroyed by frostbite."<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[832]</a>&mdash;"At Durham Downs (Queensland),
'king' Brady had a little boy, two years old, who became
<span class="pb" id="Pg271">[271]</span>
helpless from disease; the mother carried him about with
her for many years."<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor" title="J. Fraser, loc. cit., p. 44.">[833]</a>&mdash;"Then again, the transport of delight
with which Buckley was received by a woman of a local tribe
who believed that this white man was her deceased son come
to life again, is a proof of the strength of natural affection
among them."<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[834]</a></p>

<p>To this last might be added several other instances where
white people were received with the greatest love and affection
by their "black parents," who believed them to be their dead
children. As we mentioned these examples above (<a href="#Pg222">p. 222</a>)
in another connection we merely refer the reader to that
place.</p>

<p>Salvado says: "Reprenant la suite de mon récit, je dirai
que les fils adultes payent de retour l'affection de leurs parents.
S'ils sont vieux, ils réservent pour eux les meilleures pièces de
gibier, ou de tout autre mets, et se chargent de venger leurs
offenses. Enfin ils leurs témoignent leur amour au delà de la
tombe, en tuant un ou deux sauvages quand leur père vient
à mourir."<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor" title="Salvado, loc. cit., p. 277.">[835]</a></p>

<p>In the description of mourning and burial it appears in
several places that the "immediate relations," probably in
the first place their own parents and children, have special
duties and obligations. "In the Tongaranka tribe, when a
death occurs, the immediate relations smear themselves with
<i>Kopai</i> (gypsum)."<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 451.">[836]</a></p>

<p>"When one of the ... Wiim-baio tribe died ... the relations
used to lie with their heads on the body, and even
stretched at length on the corpse."<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[837]</a> In the same tribe
after a man's death "his immediate relations cut off their
hair and applied to their heads a paste."<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 452.">[838]</a></p>

<p>In the Chepara tribe "the relations of a dead person for
several months after wore emu feathers, dyed red." "The
mother of the deceased had her nose and all her body painted
with stripes of white pipeclay, and wore red feathers over the
whole of her head. A sister had also her head covered with
red feathers, but was not painted white. After a few weeks
the painting was changed to red, and then was worn by
father, mother and sisters for a long time."<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 469.">[839]</a></p>

<p>At Port Stephens "an old couple had an only daughter of
whom they were very fond. She died, and her parents built
their hut over her grave close to the shore of the harbour,
and lived there many months, crying for her every evening
at sunset."<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 465.">[840]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg272">[272]</span>
In the description of mourning ceremonies given by Spencer
and Gillen it appears plainly that the rôle of the individual
mother was quite singular and the most important. "The
actual mother of the deceased was painted deeply all over
with pipeclay."<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 508.">[841]</a> "On the way to the grave the actual
mother often threw herself heavily on the ground and attempted
to cut her head with a digging stick."<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 509.">[842]</a></p>

<p>Also the blood brother plays, apparently, a part different
from that of the tribal ones. "After going a short distance
they were met by a man who was a blood brother of the dead
woman, and was accompanied by a number of his tribal
brothers."<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 508.">[843]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this evidence, although relatively scanty, shows
clearly that the individual relations between parents and
children continued to be strong and intimate. This fact
also throws light on the character of these relations during
early childhood. In this period the bonds were formed,
and they must have been formed in a very strong and
thorough manner indeed if they lasted so long. This
conclusion is of such a general and fundamental character,
and the evidence is so scanty, that it would be futile to
attempt tracing any geographical distinctions between
the different tribes. Like the other general conclusions
arrived at in this chapter, it has features common to all
the aboriginal tribes of Australia.</p>

<p>We have extremely scanty information concerning
the relation between brothers and sisters; and the few
hints we possess are very contradictory. Thus Gason
says that a brother and sister "would sacrifice their lives
for one another if called upon."<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor" title="J.A.I., xxiv. p. 170.">[844]</a> And Fraser informs us
that when a man is sick it is his brother's duty to tend
him and carry him about. And the author gives an
example in support of this statement.<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 44.">[845]</a> And again we
read in Oldfield that a girl, if her mother is dead, "is
bound to supply them (her brothers) with food for a
certain period; indeed, brothers in general retain the
privilege of maltreating their sisters long after these
<span class="pb" id="Pg273">[273]</span>
latter became the property of another."<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor" title="Oldfield, p. 249.">[846]</a> On the other
hand, Grey states that no "common bond of union" exists
between brothers and sisters of the same father.<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., ii. p. 230.">[847]</a> And
according to Spencer and Gillen a man may never speak
from a near to his younger sister, although he may speak
freely to his older one.<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nat. Tr., p. 89.">[848]</a> Among the natives of Yorke's
Peninsula brothers and sisters were not allowed to
converse.<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor" title="Sutton, loc. cit., p. 19.">[849]</a> In some West Australian tribes the boy was
never allowed to speak to his sisters after the initiation
ceremony. He had to say farewell to his sisters before
he went to the initiation. The "own" brothers and
sisters keep apart from each other. And even boys or
girls of the same class cannot speak or play together.<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor" title="Mrs. D. M. Bates, loc. cit., p. 5. The same is reported by A. L. P. Cameron of the natives of Cooper's Creek. Science of Man. July 1904.">[850]</a>
The first three statements appear to indicate a close
individual relationship between brother and sister; the
four following seem to deny it again. Recalling to mind
what we learned about the relation in question in other
connections, we hardly get much help therefrom. The
exchange of sisters would point to some ties; but, it is
too uncertain a hint. The facts that children are suckled
for a long time, and that owing to that and to the practice
of infanticide connected with it, the children succeed
each other at long intervals, reduce the possibility of
close ties between the children of the same parents;
especially as they so soon leave the parental camp, and
as probably afterwards the intercourse between the
sisters and brothers is interrupted (compare statements of
Curr and Spencer and Gillen). On the whole we know
very little about the relation in question; and we may
only conjecture, although with a high degree of probability,
that the tie is not a very strong one and does not
play an important part in family life; if it were otherwise
we probably would know more about it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<span class="pb" id="Pg274">[274]</span><br />
<small>ECONOMICS</small></h2>

<p>Now we proceed to pass in survey the economic facts
connected with family life in Australia. As we are dealing
with the individual family, the first question that
naturally presents itself is: How far in Australia is the
individual family an economic unit? In other words,
in what way is the individuality of the single family
determined by the economic facts?</p>

<p>To answer this general question we are led to examine
various sets of facts. In the first place, we know that in
primitive societies there is already a rudimentary division
of labour, or rather a division of economic functions,
within the household. It is usually called the sexual
division of labour; obviously it makes the household an
economic unit; for it is just the division of labour which
establishes the unity of a social group from the economic
point of view. We must ask, therefore: Which, respectively,
are the chief functions of the husband and of the
wife? Who provides the food and performs the labours
of the camp?</p>

<p>The economic unity of the family may also be constituted
by other facts. It is necessary in this connection
to say a few words again of individual land ownership,
discussed above in connection with the mode of living;
several statements must be adduced referring to the
well-known features of communism and general liberality
among the Australian blacks. These features throw
considerable light upon native economics with reference
to the constitution of the family. Let us begin by
examining the evidence on the sexual division of labour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pb" id="Pg275">[275]</span>
<i>Statements.</i>&mdash;The question of the economic side of family
life is quite correctly set forth and answered by Howitt<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., pp. 206, 207.">[851]</a>:
Amongst the Kurnai, as "the pairing family is strictly
established," we might expect "that the domestic life,
the arrangements of the family circle, and the division of
labour should conform, more or less perfectly, to that condition....
The man has to provide for his family with the
assistance of his wife. His share is to hunt for their support
and to fight for their protection." The woman has to build
the hut, to fish, to gather fruit seeds and all vegetable food,
and to weave rush bags or nets. "The supply of vegetable
food procured by the woman is all devoted to her husband,
her children and herself."<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 263.">[852]</a> The man's contribution goes
only in part to supply the wants of his own family, the rest
being divided between other relatives (see below). Fishing
belonged to both sexes.<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 761.">[853]</a></p>

<p>Dawson reports the existence of permanent and temporary
dwellings in his tribes. "The men share the labour of
making the permanent dwelling, but the women are compelled
to erect the smaller one."<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor" title="It is probable that these are innovations since the advent of white men. See Howitt, Kam. and Kurn., p. 206.">[854]</a> The women carry in bags on their
back all domestic utensils, as sticks, tinder for producing fire,
gum for cement, shells, tools, charms and food. The custom
of carrying burning fire-sticks is also reported by Dawson.<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor" title="J. Dawson, p. 11.">[855]</a>
And in another place we read: "After marriage the women
are compelled to do all the hard work of erecting habitations,
collecting fuel and water, carrying burdens, procuring roots
and delicacies of various kinds, making baskets for cooking
roots and other purposes, preparing food, and attending to the
children. The only work the men do in time of peace is to
hunt for opossums and large animals of various kinds, and
to make rugs and weapons."<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 36, 37.">[856]</a></p>

<p>A still clearer picture of the division of labour between the
sexes is drawn by Curr in his Memoirs. On the march the
men carried the arms and their personal effects; the women
had to carry all the other implements as well as the small
children. The supply of vegetable food belonged to them.<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor" title="Recollections, p. 251.">[857]</a>
When several families camped together the women went in
parties to procure roots, small animals and other food,
carrying babies on their backs and followed by other children.
<span class="pb" id="Pg276">[276]</span>
The men, in parties of three or four, went out hunting. After
returning to camp, each party cooked its food. The men,
however, gave to their wives only the remainder of their
food, sharing it first with the children; it seems, therefore,
that the food supply provided by the female was much more
regular and reliable, and therefore of greater importance to
the family, than the man's share.<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor" title="Recollections, p. 256.">[858]</a> And again we read: "At
the family fires the father generally cooked the animals
which he brought home, and the woman the roots which were
her contribution."<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[859]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of all the Australian tribes in general, Curr says:
"Among the Australian blacks the common occupations of
the men are the manufacture of arms and implements for
hunting, fishing and occasionally war. The women generally
procure and cook vegetables and fish, collect wood for fire,
manufacture nets and bags. On the march the woman carries
child, household effects, fire-stick, and digs for roots and
vegetables."<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor" title="Curr, A.R., i. p. 99.">[860]</a> "Wives have to undergo all the drudgery of
the camp and the march, have the poorest food and the
hardest work."<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 110.">[861]</a> This statement gives quite clearly the
division of labour, the greater share falling on the wife.</p>

<p>Amongst the Mount Gambier tribes (West Victoria) the
females have to construct the lodge, to collect firewood, and
to make the fire.<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor" title="Stanbridge, loc. cit., p. 290.">[862]</a> They always carry the fire-stick when travelling.<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 291.">[863]</a>
They fetch water and collect all vegetable food, roots,
and mushrooms, with their digging-stick.<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[864]</a> The men's task is
hunting; they do it generally in company.<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 293.">[865]</a> Men make arms
and prepare skins; women, objects of use and adornment.<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 295.">[866]</a></p>

<p>We read in Angas that carrying all the things, digging of
roots, and making the huts is woman's work.<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 82, 84, 87.">[867]</a></p>

<p>Eyre says that the women had to dress the huts.<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., ii. p. 302.">[868]</a></p>

<p>We read in Br. Smyth that women had to carry all the
"worldly goods" of their husbands, even part of their arms.<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 85. This is a quotation on the authority of an observer (Jardine).">[869]</a></p>

<p>The men hunt and women collect food during their march
according to Protector Thomas. There exists a customary
communism among them.<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 767.">[870]</a></p>

<p>Mitchell says that because of their great skill in manufacturing
all the things of daily use as "nets, cloaks, mussel-fishing,
rooting, etc.; and their patient submission to labour,
<span class="pb" id="Pg277">[277]</span>
always carrying bags containing the whole property of the
family while they follow their masters, the great value of a
gin to one of these lazy fellows may be easily imagined."<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor" title="Quoted by Br. Smyth, i. p. 85.">[871]</a>
They are, therefore, the chief objects of all their fights.</p>

<p>Meyer states about the Encounter Bay tribes that the
man regarded his wife as a slave and let her do all the hard
work, employing her in all ways to his advantage.<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 191.">[872]</a> He even
prostituted her for objects of use.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor" title="This may be the influence of culture, as Europeans are mentioned in connection therewith.">[873]</a> But he states also the
typical division of labour: "the men employ themselves ...
either in fishing or hunting emus, opossums, kangaroos, etc.,
while the women and children search for roots and plants."
It is also the women's task to arrange the encampments.<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor" title="pp. 191, 192.">[874]</a></p>

<p>In the Port Lincoln tribes men provided animal and women
vegetable food.<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor" title="Schürmann, loc. cit., p. 221.">[875]</a></p>

<p>We read in another author, about the same tribes, that
women have to collect vegetable food, while the men are
hunting.<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor" title="Chas. Wilhelmi, pp. 174, 175, 177.">[876]</a> There is also some kind of division of consumption;
men eat male, women female animals, and children the small
ones.<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 176.">[877]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the Port Jackson tribes, Tench says that they
derive their principal food supply from fishing. Both men
and women take part in this; the men spearing the fish and
the women catching them from land and sea. Both husband
and wife bring their shares to the common household.<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 193-196.">[879]</a></p>

among the natives of Botany Bay.<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor" title="Phillip, p. 31.">[880]</a></p>

<p>According to Henderson, among some of the New South
Wales tribes the women have to carry children and all
burdens; they procure also roots and shellfish.<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 122.">[881]</a></p>

<p>Fishing was the chief support of the aborigines of Port
Jackson described by D. Collins. In procuring this food,
men, women and children were employed.<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor" title="Collins, i. p. 556.">[883]</a></p>

<p>In the compilation of Dr. Fraser, on the New South Wales
tribes, we have a detailed account of the sexual division of
labour. The woman has to put up the wurley; to light and
<span class="pb" id="Pg278">[278]</span>
keep the fire, to carry the fire-stick, to cook the food. On
the march she carries the bag containing the whole property
of the family, the children and the yam-stick. Her duty is
to provide fish and vegetable food.<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 2.">[884]</a> The man has only to
hunt.<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 60.">[885]</a></p>

<p>All the drudgery of the camp and all the hard work was the
lot of the women. They made nets and bags and they
carried, on the marches, all the domestic implements as well
as the children.<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor" title="Port Stephens tribes. R. Dawson, p. 67.">[886]</a></p>

<p>"I have observed that upon the northern coasts of Australia
the amount of the population upon a certain tract of country
is great or small in proportion to the quantity of <em>vegetable</em>
food it produces. However abundant animal food may be,
a toilsome search for edible roots gives almost constant
occupation to a portion of every tribe. Women and children
labour for hours together, with no other implement than a
pointed stick, in following up the creeping stem of the wild
yam through the earth until the root is arrived at, often at a
depth of six or eight feet below the surface. A certain proportion
of vegetable food appears, indeed, to be absolutely
necessary to their existence, and they willingly forego the use
of the animal food, if this more grateful diet can be obtained
in sufficient abundance."<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor" title="Earl, p. 251.">[890]</a></p>

<p>We are informed that among the Bunya-Bunya people

<p>Among the aborigines of Moreton Bay, women have to

<p>We owe a good description of the division of labour on
the march to Mathew: "When shifting from one campingground
to another they usually moved slowly through the
bush, the families separating and gathering their food on the
way&mdash;opossums, bandicoots, honey, grubs, birds, and so
forth. At other times they marched along singly, the lords
<span class="pb" id="Pg279">[279]</span>
of creation stepping out with elastic tread and graceful bearing,
carrying their light weapons with perhaps some game, the
weaker vessel loaded with the chattels and possibly a baby
on the back in a loop of a rug or sitting stride-leg on a shoulder.
Some would carry live fire-sticks to save the trouble of producing
fire by friction. Arrived at the familiar, well-chosen
rendezvous, it was the duty of the women to cut the bark of
the humpies (dwellings) and prepare the fires."<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 83.">[893]</a> Further
on we read: "The women were skilled in the manufacture
of nets and of dillie-bags made of grass or twine."<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 82.">[894]</a> "The
man's chief home duties consisted in cooking and eating.

<p>Lumholtz speaks of the woman as the slave of her husband.

We see here again the economic value of a wife directly
stated. In another place: "It is the women who daily
provide food," often making long excursions for this purpose,
and collecting fruits, digging roots and chopping larvæ out of
the tree-stems. "She must do all the hard work," carry the
baby, make the fire, cook, provide water and fuel, dress the
hut. She carries all the baggage on the march, as well as the
children. The man carries only his arms. "The husband's
contribution to the household is chiefly honey, but occasionally
he provides eggs, game, lizards, and the like. He very often,
however, keeps the animal food for himself, while the woman
has to depend principally upon vegetables for herself and
her child. Upon the whole he feels no responsibility as
the father of a family."<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 160, 161.">[897]</a> It is interesting to find that

baskets.<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 193.">[898]</a></p>

<p>Among the North-West Queensland tribes: "It is the
husband's business, in the main, to supply the animal food
for the family, and although a particular dietary may be
forbidden him he has no compunction in hunting or killing
it for his kith and kin."<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor" title="Eth. Stud., p. 184.">[899]</a> It is necessary to add that according
to Roth's information each member of a given family
has some special food forbidden to him; because each class
has its special food taboos, and in a family the father, the
mother and the children, each belong to a different class.<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 57.">[900]</a>

labour is reported in another place by the same author. We
read there that the father's duty was to supply his family with

considerable distance, carrying all the implements and often
the children.<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor" title="N.Q. Eth. Bull. 8, p. 9, § 2.">[903]</a></p>

<p>The economic division of labour, based upon the co-operation
of both sexes, is stated by Scott Nind. The women and
men go out in search of food, or hunting, in separate parties.
The women chiefly collect roots and small animals; men go
out hunting. Each sex reserves a part of its share for the
family. "The women are very useful for them (their husbands),
not only in procuring food, but also in preparing
their cloaks, building their huts and other menial offices."<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., pp. 36, 37. Refers to the tribes of King George's Sound.">[917]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We see that our thirty-five statements agree pretty
well as to the general features of the division of labour.
Certain of the economic functions, like hunting, making
of weapons and, undoubtedly, the important function
of protecting the family, are allotted to the men. Other
work&mdash;the providing of roots, bulbs and other vegetable
food, camp work and carrying heavy burdens, manufacturing
nets and usually fishing&mdash;all this is the duty of the
woman. Our statements more or less agree upon this
division of labour. The more detailed ones (Howitt on
the Kurnai, Dawson, Curr, Stanbridge, Mathew, B. Field,
Oldfield, Moore) depict to us the occupations of the man
and of his wife in nearly the same words. Only in the
statements of Collins, Tench and Phillips is fishing
mentioned as a common occupation of men and women.
But these statements (probably not independent of each
other) are not so explicit and reliable as to lead us to make
exceptions of the Port Jackson tribes. We may, therefore,
affirm the existence of a very marked sexual division
of labour, which seems to present everywhere the same
features and to be nearly identical over the whole continent.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prima facie</i> this division of labour consists only
in each sex having its different occupations prescribed
by custom. But more careful analysis shows that there
are other features which more deeply differentiate the
economic activities of the sexes.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg282">[282]</span>
It is easy to see that the amount of work allotted to
women is <em>considerably greater</em> and that their labour is
much <em>harder</em> than the men's work. This is directly
affirmed by a series of statements (Curr, Dawson,
Stanbridge, Tom Petrie, Mathew, Lumholtz, Forrest,
Salvado, Scott Nind, Moore). This is also undoubtedly
a reason why so many authors designate the wife's
position as that of a slave and drudge. But it also
results directly from a comparison of the occupations
allotted to women with those allotted to men. A woman
had to carry all the heavy things, all the objects of
domestic use, her own as well as her husband's; for the
man carried only his weapons (Dawson, Curr, Stanbridge,
Angas, Br. Smyth, Thomas, Phillips, Fraser,
Lumholtz, Salvado). The woman had to construct huts
and look after camping arrangements (Howitt on the
Kurnai, Dawson, Stanbridge, Meyer, Schürmann, Angas,
Howitt on the Wiradjuri, Gribble, Henderson, Fraser,
Field, Mathew, Lumholtz, Forrest, Salvado, Browne).
All this was rather hard work, especially when compared
with the man's share of work, which was mainly hunting
and fashioning weapons. It must not be forgotten that
women were often encumbered in their work by suckling,
carrying their children, and by the various cares demanded
by the latter. The digging for roots is also exceedingly
hard work (Moore, Earl).</p>

<p><em>More regular</em> and <em>systematic</em> kind of labour is also called
for by the nature of the woman's tasks. These are
intimately connected with the wandering mode of life of
the aborigines. Obviously in a people which was forced
by natural conditions to lead a roaming life, such tasks
must necessarily have required regular labour. The
other chief female occupation&mdash;collecting roots and
small animals&mdash;required also a regular kind of labour. All
these occupations&mdash;being, as just said, harder and more
systematic than men's work, clearly appear also to be
much more wearing and tiresome; compared with the
men's occupations they appear much less in the light of
<span class="pb" id="Pg283">[283]</span>
sport and amusement. The man makes his weapons and
hunts, and this is a natural and pleasant sport for him.
There are no elements of excitement or variety in the
women's work; it is just this element of system and of
regularity which makes work repulsive and hard to man,
and especially to primitive man. Work of this kind is
usually done only under a strong compulsion; and
woman's work in Australia appears also to be compulsory.
This is directly stated in several places (Dawson, Curr,
Mitchell, Forrest, Moore, Oldfield). This compulsory
character is undoubtedly another reason why the women's
position is described in other statements as that of a
slave and drudge.</p>

<p>A very important point is that the woman's share in
labour was of much more <em>vital importance</em> to the maintenance
of the household than man's work. This is quite
obvious, seeing that the general occupations of camp life
were of essential necessity for a roving people. But even
the food supply, contributed by the women, was far more
important than the man's share. We read that the chief
resource of the natives, especially in bad seasons, is
vegetable food (Oldfield). And the interesting statement
of Earl confirms this in a still stronger manner. So that
it appears fairly probable that, on the whole, food collected
by women was the staple food of the natives. But not
only does the kind of food supplied by the man appear on
the whole to be less important than that contributed by
the woman, but it seems as if the man's contribution,
which in the main was reduced to his hunting products,
was devoted much less exclusively to his family's benefit.
In order to understand this, let us adduce some statements
relating to communism of food, and giving besides some
interesting details about aboriginal economics.</p>

<p><i>Statements.</i>&mdash;Among the Kurnai<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Kam. and Kurn., App. D, p. 261. Compare Idem, Nat. Tr., pp. 756-759.">[918]</a> the hunter who killed a
big piece of game gave some of it to the men who assisted
him in killing, cooking or carving. The chief parts were
<span class="pb" id="Pg284">[284]</span>
divided among his wives' parents and his own parents. These
in return supplied their son and son-in-law respectively with
meat the next day. Similar rules, varying according to the
game and tribe, obtained also among the Murring tribes of
New South Wales.<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., pp. 264-267, and Nat. Tr., pp. 759-760 (refers to the Ngarigo tribe of the Murring nation).">[919]</a> Important for us is the general feature
of communism; the preponderancy given to the parents of
a man and his wife. If the man be unmarried he provides
chiefly his parents and his brother and sister.<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., pp. 259.">[920]</a> The grandparents
cared especially for their grandchildren.<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., pp. 262, 263.">[921]</a></p>

<p>In the Wurrunjeri tribe a kangaroo was distributed among
those present in camp and the hunter's family. The man had
(even in case of a limited food supply) to provide for his own
and his wife's parents. They cared in turn for him.<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 765.">[922]</a> Communism
obtained among the Kulin tribes.<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 767.">[923]</a></p>

<p>A communism, similar to that of the Kurnai, prevailed
among the Narran-ga.<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor" title="Of South Australia, Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 762.">[924]</a> The same is related about the tribes
of the Karamundi<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[925]</a>; the Wolgal tribe,<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 764.">[926]</a> amongst whom the
woman was provided for with food by her parents; the
Wiradjuri; Wotjobaluk; Mukjarawaint.<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[927]</a> Among the Gournditch-Mara
game was divided amongst all present in camp.<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor" title="Kam. and Kurn., p. 277 and Nat. Tr., p. 765.">[928]</a></p>

<p>J. Dawson states that food brought by a hunter to the
camp was distributed so that he and even his brother gets
the worst part of it. "The best pieces of birds and quadrupeds
and the finest eels" were given away. An anecdote is
told in support of this statement which appears trustworthy.<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor" title="Dawson, p. 22.">[929]</a>
It may be pointed out that this apparently refers only to
food brought by men; and that this statement only says that
the shares of the individual and his brother were neglected;
but it does not make clear how the shares of the other
relations (family, wife, parents) were regulated, if they were
favoured or the reverse.</p>

<p>In the Chepara tribe, the men, women and children went
out every morning to hunt and search for food. It was a
man's duty to provide food. This food was divided equally
amongst all those present by the old men. A man had special
duties towards his wife's parents if they were sick and unable
to hunt.<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 768.">[930]</a> Here we see a communism which gives no preference
to any relation, and apparently treats equally all the
members of the local group.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg285">[285]</span>
Curious customs obtained among the Narrinyeri, when an
emu was killed. It was first divided by an old man with some
ceremonies, apart from the camp, and then carried to the
camp and eaten by men, women and children alike.<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 763.">[931]</a> This
shows, by the way, that big game like emu, or kangaroo,
must be rather an exceptional feast; and as all the communistic
customs in this connection refer to bigger game, they
do not affect, perhaps, so much the everyday food supply,
which is due chiefly to females.</p>

<p>Among the Port Lincoln tribes "the custom of dividing
their food amongst each other is so common that he who
fails to observe this rule is branded as a sort of miser."<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor" title="Chas. Wilhelmi, p. 192.">[932]</a></p>

<p>Among the Yerkla-Mining tribe, all present in camp shared
equally the animal killed. The slayer had to distribute it.
Women and children had also their equal share.<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor" title="Howitt, Nat. Tr., p. 762.">[933]</a></p>

<p>In his book about the New South Wales aborigines, the
Rev. J. B. Gribble writes: "Food is distributed on the
principle of community of goods."<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor" title="Loc. cit., p. 117.">[934]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the Port Stephens blacks each family provided
for its own subsistence, "except in a general kangaroo hunt,
where the game is impounded and taken in large quantities,
when it is fairly distributed."<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor" title="R. Dawson, p. 327.">[935]</a></p>

<p>Game was divided according to customary rules among the
Euahlayi.<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor" title="Mrs. Parker, loc. cit., p. 117.">[936]</a> We are informed also of some other interesting
details in this tribe: stones, used to grind seed, are kept
in family possession.<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid.">[937]</a> There seems also to be a kind of
harvest, and the storing up of some kinds of food is known.<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 118.">[938]</a></p>

<p>A series of interesting regulations as to how game is distributed
among several New South Wales tribes is given by
Mr. R. H. Mathews.<a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor" title="J.R.S.N.S.W. (1904), p. 258.">[939]</a></p>

<p>We read in Spencer and Gillen<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor" title="Nat. Tr., p. 469.">[940]</a> that a man shares his food
with his father-in-law and other relatives. It is there explicitly
stated that he shares it not only with his actual but
also with his tribal relations; in another place, however, the
same subject is treated as if the father-in-law in question were
the actual one, not a group of them. So we read<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor" title="Nor. Tr., pp. 610, 611.">[941]</a> that if
the man or boy neglected his father-in-law the latter would
take revenge at the initiation ceremony; and that the giving
of food may be considered as a form of payment for his wife.<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor" title="Compare above, ch. ii.">[942]</a></p>

<p>Among the Bunya people (Turrubul tribe, near Brisbane),
<span class="pb" id="Pg286">[286]</span>
the trees belonged to the people of the place. Visitors might
be invited to the feast; but they "purchased bags of the seeds
when they returned home."<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor" title="Petrie, Howitt's Nat. Tr., p. 768.">[943]</a></p>

<p>Exact rules of division of game are followed among some
Queensland blacks (North-West Central), "the best part
going to the father's camp, the next to the father's brother."<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor" title="Palmer, J.A.I., xiii. p. 285.">[944]</a>
The man himself goes often very short, being with his gin
quite neglected.</p>

<p>Among some of the West Australian tribes (Murchison
District, Watchandee tribe) a very high degree of communism
in food is reached among the men. If a man was
unlucky at the chase he was sure to receive food in the
evening at camp from all the other hunters. Was a man
pre-eminently successful, he divided his booty with all
his friends.<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor" title="Oldfield, p. 271.">[945]</a> We find also another testimonial to the high
liberality of the natives and their sense of communism, in a
passage of the same writer,<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor" title="Ibid., p. 226.">[946]</a> where we are informed that a
native supplied a party of white settlers with game for
many days, being told that they were short of food.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us apply these statements in the first place to
the question of the division of labour. We see that in
all this evidence, the question is merely one of communism
in game. With the exception, perhaps, of
the summary statements of Mrs. Parker, J. B. Gribble
and Wilhelmi, all the others speak clearly of communism
in game only. And, on the other hand, we can conclude,
as so many statements report the customary division of
any large hunting products, that game was practically
always divided more or less equally among those present
in camp, the relatives of the hunter receiving the major
part, but he himself and his wife being probably neglected.<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor" title="This communism and liberality stand in close connection with the fact that the natives did not lay in provisions. They have to partake with their neighbours of any large booty, since otherwise it would perish.">[947]</a>
The valuable statement of R. Dawson expresses
this directly: in other respects each family provided
for its own subsistence, but if big game were
killed it became the property of the whole group. We
<span class="pb" id="Pg287">[287]</span>
see that in all probability the results of the man's
labour&mdash;the big game&mdash;did not go to the exclusive use
of his family. This is stated emphatically by some
authors, who say that the woman did not get even her
share of the results of the man's work (Moore, Curr,
Lumholtz, Oldfield). But some say, on the other hand,
that both husband and wife shared equally in providing
food. From several statements of the authors (Roth,
Spencer and Gillen, Howitt) it must probably be assumed
that the husband also gave in his share to the common
household. But on summing up all the data here brought
forward, it may be considered positively certain that the
woman's part is of vital importance for the maintenance
of the family, while the husband's share is quite
secondary.</p>

<p>To sum up, it may be said that the sexual division of
labour consists not only in different occupations being
laid upon the man and the woman by custom. This
division of labour is much deeper rooted, viz. in the fact
that man's and woman's work is of quite different kind.
The woman's work is on the whole much heavier than
that done by the man; her work is much more regular;
it is compulsory, and it forms the chief support of the
household. These features of the division of labour are
of great sociological importance.</p>

<p>1. It appears that the sexual division of labour is
based only partly on differences in the natural capacities
of the sexes. Heavier work ought naturally to be performed
by men; here the contrary obtains. Only so far
as the hunting is allotted to men and collecting to women,
do natural gifts appear to be taken into account. But
even here the woman's work appears to be much more
exacting, inasmuch as it requires a steady strain, patience
and regularity. Such work is the most repulsive; it
differs most essentially from sport, and it is carried on
only under strong compulsion. Compulsion is therefore,
as we saw, the chief basis of this division of labour, and it
may be said that in the Australian aboriginal society the
<span class="pb" id="Pg288">[288]</span>
economic fact of division of labour is rooted in a sociological
status&mdash;viz. the compulsion of the weaker sex by
the "brutal" half of society. This fact gains a deeper
and more general aspect if brought into connection
with the "terrorism produced upon women"<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor" title="Hutton Webster, loc. cit., pp. 99, 100 (ch. vi.).">[948]</a> by the
members of the tribal secret society, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> by all the
initiated men.</p>

<p>2. From its compulsory character it follows that the
distribution of economic functions does not correspond
to true co-operation, but that the relation of a husband
to his wife is, in its economic aspect, that of a
master to his slave.<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Niboer, loc. cit., p. 23.">[949]</a> And this throws also some light
on the value of a wife to a man. (Compare the statements
of Mitchell, Br. Smyth, Lumholtz.)</p>

<p>3. The woman's work appears as the chief basis
of the economy of the Australian household. Her work
goes exclusively towards the benefit of the individual
family, and this latter economically is entirely dependent
upon woman's work. It is her work which, taking to
itself the most considerable share in the sexual division
of labour, plays the main part in giving to the individual
family its economic unity.</p>

<p>There is still to be noted the statement of Roth,
who reports the existence of class taboos which establish
what we would call a division of consumption between
the father, mother and children; each of these three parties
belonging to a different class. That this statement is a
result of careful and frequent and not merely casual observation,
further, that this division of consumption plays an
important part in the native family life, may be accepted
as very probable. For the author, who is undoubtedly
among our best, most exact and conscientious ethnographers,
builds upon the rule in question a theory of the
origin of classes. The whole class system has been
devised by a process of natural selection, to regulate
the proper distribution of the total quantity of food
<span class="pb" id="Pg289">[289]</span>
available.<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor" title="In a paper read before the Royal Society of Queensland, December 11, 1897, Proc., p. 10. Quoted by Frazer, Tot. and Exog., i. p. 137. Also in Eth. Stud., p. 69.">[950]</a> And although we cannot enter here into the
discussion whether this view be right or not, it may serve
us as a guarantee that Roth had ascertained the great
importance of the class taboo he describes and its prevalence
over a wide area. For otherwise he would not have
based such an important theory about one of the most
crucial problems of ethnology on a single fact. Besides
Roth's statement there is further the information of
Wilhelmi about division of consumption within the family.</p>

<p>At all events, although the evidence upon the division
of consumption is rather scanty, the evidence about the
division of labour is plentiful, and this latter may be
regarded as one of the well-established features of Australian
sociology.<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor" title="Prof. Durkheim has pointed out (D. Tr. S., pp. 19 sqq.) that the division of social functions has a most important share in creating the unity of a given group, and amongst other things in creating the solidarity of marriage: 'C'est la division du travail sexuel qui est la source de la solidarité conjugal' (loc. cit., p. 19). ...">[951]</a> The features of communism show us
also that individual property in land has little economic
meaning. If there is game, the privilege of hunting it is
not an important one, since all members of the friendly
group will partake of the results. To what was said
<span class="pb" id="Pg290">[290]</span>
regarding the unity of the family as an exclusive land
owner (above, <a href="#Pg150">pp. 150</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>), there is, therefore, nothing
to be added.</p>

<p>The custom of a communistic division of game points
also to the acknowledgment of family ties beyond the
narrow circle of the individual family.<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor" title="It will be remembered that individual family means throughout this book: husband, wife and their young children living with them.">[952]</a> For the duty of
a man in distributing the game, according to the majority
of our statements (about eight in thirteen), is governed
in the first place by the degree of relationship in which he
stands to different people. And it is the individual, not
the group relationship that is to be taken into account
here. In Howitt's statements (which are the best) we
see that the parents-in-law stand always in the first place.
This agrees with what we read in Spencer and Gillen; and
from both these statements we may conclude that these
duties are a sort of continuation or equivalent of the
bride-price, of which we find traces in Australia.</p>

<p>Let us say a few words about inheritance. As inheritance
implies the existence of private property, we may
look for it only where there is private property in
Australia. In the first place there is "private landed
property." We saw that "property" must be understood
in the cases of individuals much more in a mystic,
magical sense than otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor" title="Compare above, pp. 150, 153.">[953]</a> Moreover, in the few
cases where there is any mention of individual property
in land, we found very little information about the
principles according to which it is inherited. According
to Roth, whose statement on individual proprietorship
is the clearest one, we know that this individual right to
land is not hereditary, but determined for magical and
mystical reasons. In the other cases we are not informed
at all how the individual or family comes into possession,
or are informed in such an inexact way<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Eyre's and Grey's statements, where heredity appears to be in the male line. Also Salvado, p. 265.">[954]</a> that we cannot
<span class="pb" id="Pg291">[291]</span>
attach much value to the information. From our best
sources (Spencer and Gillen and Roth) we know that the
ties binding an individual to a given locality are of mystical,
magico-religious character, and were determined not
by heredity, but by a special principle connected with
their beliefs, and we may suppose that this was the rule,
especially as individual land ownership seems to be on the
whole more of a magico-religious than of a purely economic
order. As to the inheritance of other property, there is
little to say about it, unimportant as it was itself.<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor" title="Compare Wheeler, loc. cit., p. 36.">[955]</a>
According to some writers, it passes from father to son
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> Fraser). Elsewhere we read that it is inherited
by certain groups of men from their common relations.<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor" title="Spencer and Gillen, Nor. Tr., pp. 615-617.">[956]</a>
On the whole, inheritance does not seem to form any
important binding element between parents and children,
either in the male or in the female line.<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor" title="Compare also the statements collected by Wheeler on this point, loc. cit., pp. 36 sqq.">[957]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<span class="pb" id="Pg292">[292]</span><br />
<small>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</small></h2>

<p>The aim of the foregoing pages was to give a correct
description of the Australian individual family.<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor" title="See p. 290, note 1.">[958]</a> The
chief practical difficulties lay in the methodological
treatment of the evidence; in other words, in making
the fullest possible use of the material, without inadvertently
introducing conjectural elements. We established
the necessity of our task by pointing out the following
facts: (1) The contradictions, incompleteness and
lack of precision in the descriptions of the individual
family, given by field ethnographers, who sometimes
even go so far as to deny the existence of this institution,
such denials being based not upon observation, but upon
speculative inference. (2) The discussion of the problem
in question or of parts of it (marriage, relationship,
descent, etc.), as usually found in ethnographical and
sociological works, relates chiefly to the earlier stages
of this institution, and as a rule leaves out of sight a series
of important points, concerning its actual working, to
draw attention to which was in part the aim of the present
investigations. Now, considering that ethnological
material, especially that from the Australian continent,
plays a very important rôle in all general speculations on
the history of marriage and the family&mdash;Australia being
the best-known and the most extensive country inhabited
by a very primitive race&mdash;it seemed that a careful examination
of the facts of family life in Australia would be
useful. (3) In the third place it appeared that a minute
investigation in this direction might be interesting as an
example of a correct sociological definition of the individual
family in a given society. To give it, there had to
<span class="pb" id="Pg293">[293]</span>
be made a careful collection and classification of material
in order to show which facts play an important part in
the structure and functions of this institution.</p>

<p>An over-hasty comparative survey of social phenomena,
especially if the writer is disposed to see everywhere
analogies or even identities without due criticism, too
often exaggerates irrelevant features and under-rates the
most essential ones in a given area. To obtain an adequate
picture of any social institution, even if so well marked
by many physiological facts as is the individual family,
it is necessary to set forth those of its features which are
characteristic in a given society. Further, it appeared
necessary to point out some facts, which show that the
institution of the individual family is deeply connected
with a whole series of customs, beliefs and fundamental
phenomena of Australian society; and that it thus appears
deeply rooted in its social conditions. In other words,
that the individual family is the object of a set of well-determined,
categorical, collective ideas. This modest
task of a correct and detailed description, made on the
basis of sufficient ethnographical material, was the chief
aim of the present study.</p>

<p>A few words may be said in the first place about the
practical difficulties met with in dealing with the evidence,
as foreseen and discussed in the chapter on methodology.
The views there set out were, briefly, that it is impossible
to use the statements in their crude form, and that consequently
they must be submitted to criticism; and that
it is necessary also to use caution and method in drawing
inferences from the evidence. The results seem to confirm
these views. So, for example, we often met with a
great deal of inaccuracy&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> in expressions like tribe,
tribal, community, group, family&mdash;and we had always to
be cautious and to ascertain carefully their meaning when
dealing with the aboriginal mode of living. Sometimes
we were able to ascertain this real meaning; sometimes
the statement was quite or nearly useless owing to complete
confusion. Furthermore, all qualifying expressions
<span class="pb" id="Pg294">[294]</span>
referring to the treatment and behaviour of husband and
wife, expressions referring to sexual morality, etc., were
in the highest degree inexact. Throughout the whole
study there was constant necessity for dealing critically
with the text of the evidence.</p>

<p>In the second place we had always to analyze the
information and to ask a series of definite questions
of it. So, for example, in the sexual side of family
life we divided our problem into three main questions,
and these again into sub-headings. Again the relations
between husband and wife were viewed from the
legal point (authority of husband), from the psychological
point (affection), and in their functional aspect
(behaviour and treatment). The relations between
parents and children were divided into several headings
(affection, treatment, education, etc.), and so forth. On
some of such particular points it has been possible to
obtain quite definite answers. Where there was a hopeless
contradiction, it was carefully pointed out. In the
same manner a reliable but apparently singular statement
was carefully noted, even if it differed from all the rest of
the information. In general the chief methodic rule in
utilizing the evidence was to arrange the whole argument
and inferences in the clearest possible manner. To this
end the number of the statements for and against any
opinion was always given; the compatibility of a given
inference with the well-established facts of Australian
sociology was investigated; and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</i>,
so much recommended by Steinmetz, was applied wherever
possible. Attention also has been paid to the geographical
point of view. Wherever it has been possible
to ascertain local differences in customs, beliefs or institutions,
or to show that such differences are localized in
more extensive areas, care was taken to point it out. It
is obviously an error to take "the Australian Aborigines"
as an ethnic unit. Nevertheless many general, fundamental
features of family life are undoubtedly common
to all the tribes.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg295">[295]</span>
The individual family involves both the individual
relations between husband and wife, and between parents
and children.<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor" title="In the more restricted sense used throughout this book. Extended family, Grossfamilie, involves more remote relationship.">[959]</a> These two relationships are obviously
so intimately connected that the individuality of one of
them has as its consequence the individuality of the
other; each characteristic feature of one of them stands
in a functional relation to some characteristic feature of
the other. Both these relationships were studied and their
mutual dependence in several respects was indicated.</p>

<p>A series of facts was adduced in order to prove that the
individual relationship between husband and wife is unquestionably
affirmed in the collective ideas of the natives.
These facts, chiefly connected with the modes of obtaining
wives (also with burial and mourning), implied even more
detailed ideas: the affirmation that the husband has a
series of individual rights and duties in regard to his
wife; in other words that there is a mutual personal
appropriation of husband and wife.</p>

<p>From some of the details as to the modes of obtaining
wives the idea of individual appropriation can be
clearly gathered. The family disposes of the female
and benefits thereby; the disposal is effected in infancy,
so it appears that the majority of females are always
allotted. The individual appropriation is, so to say, a
permanent status, extending not only to the married
women, but to all females in the tribe. Only a man deeply
in love, or impelled by some other desperate reason,
attempts to elope with a female or to capture one. This
always constitutes a crime, and is either punished or
atoned for. Nevertheless, elopement occurs pretty often
and has its fixed forms of legalization. This state of things
obviously expresses the idea of individual appropriation
in the strongest and most certain manner. Individual
appropriation is further expressed in a whole system of
ties binding the families of the two contracting parties,
and especially binding the man to his (future or actual)
<span class="pb" id="Pg296">[296]</span>
parents-in-law. In this latter case the ties consist in the
first place of obligations, chiefly gifts and the duty of
supplying game. These obligations and the widespread
custom of exchange of females appear to be a rudimentary
form of marriage by purchase. Hence, again, a confirmation
that individual marital rights are well known and
acknowledged. Marriage by purchase implies a fair
knowledge of individual appropriation, and shows that
it is highly valued in a given society. In Australia the
"bride money" is paid by an individual, not by a group.
We find evidence of a number of betrothal and marriage
ceremonies which carry in themselves binding powers.
Such ceremonies mean that the underlying ideas are deeply
rooted in the society where the ceremonies are found. In
this case, the underlying ideas are that man and wife
are firmly bound to each other by the ceremony. All
these facts appear very important. Not only do they
indicate that the ideas of the legality or illegality of the
marriage contract&mdash;those of personal individual appropriation
and of a high value attaching to marriage rights&mdash;exist
in Australia. But it is difficult to reconcile with
them the view that individual marriage is in Australia
something new, a kind of innovation; that it is considered
by the natives as something immoral, illicit, an encroachment
of the individual on the rights of the group; and as
something unimportant, secondary, merely temporary.
On the contrary, as we find it existing, it bears the
character of a deeply-rooted institution. All these conclusions
have also been drawn independently from the
general character and several details of the mourning
customs. So that the discussion of these customs afforded
another proof that marriage ties are considered very
strong, and that the institution of marriage is the object
of definite collective ideas, consequently is firmly established
in the social organization. It has a social sanction
and appears fairly permanent.</p>

<p>These facts suffice formally to define the individual
marriage and individual rights of the husband to his wife.
<span class="pb" id="Pg297">[297]</span>
To give full context to this definition, and to characterize
it more in detail, we must, on the one hand, investigate
the general character of the behaviour of the consorts
towards each other, and the feelings to which this behaviour
points. On the other hand, an attempt must be
made to determine the collective ideas expressing this
relationship in its legal aspect. There have been, however,
considerable difficulties in determining the emotional
side of the relation between husband and wife. The
results were rather negative; it appeared that we cannot
accept either the extreme view of absolute bad treatment
and want of affection, or the contrary opinion that the
relations are of idyllic character. In general&mdash;allowing
for a natural variety of feelings&mdash;the preponderance of
feelings of attachment appears to be the rule. Much
clearer are the results reached concerning the husband's
actual rights over his wife. His authority is limited in
some extreme cases only; and it is difficult to say who
would interfere with it and what would be the legal form
of such an interference. It may be said, therefore, that
the treatment of females in Australia is determined much
more by personal feelings than by legal norms, and that
the latter only afford protection to the woman in cases
of extreme illtreatment. In accordance with what has
just been said as to personal feelings, it appears also that
the treatment of women was not so exceedingly rough as
is usually assumed.</p>

<p>The sexual rights of the husband must rather be understood
in the sense that the husband is a proprietor of his
wife, who may and occasionally must dispose of her; not
in the sense of an inviolable exclusiveness of sexual access.
The idea of chastity is absent. And consequently jealousy
is not in existence in the sense in which we use that word in
our society. But it exists in the form of ideas and feelings
affirming the husband's definite right of control over his
wife. And the natives highly disapprove of any transgression
without the husband's consent and the sanction
of custom. All sexual licence is regulated and subject to
<span class="pb" id="Pg298">[298]</span>
strict rules. Consequently the ideas on what is right or
wrong in sexual matters are fairly well defined. In other
words, there is a more or less defined code of sexual
morality, which has also its legal aspect, as crimes
against it are punished by society in a regulated
manner.</p>

<p>In reference to the problems of individual marriage
and the individual family, it may be said, however, that
the individualistic character of these institutions is not
accentuated in the first place by the exclusiveness of
sexual rights. In connection with sexual problems an
excursus on the Pirrauru customs was made, in order to
prove that the relationship involved does not possess the
character of marriage. For it completely differs from
marriage in nearly all the essential points by which marriage
in Australia is defined. And above all the Pirrauru
relation does not seem to involve the facts of family life
in its true sense.</p>

<p>In order to investigate the latter in detail on a broader
basis, that is including both the relations between parents
and children and between husband and wife, we entered
into a discussion of the relation of the family unit to the
territorial distribution of the natives. It was found that
the mode of living points to a very complete isolation of
each family; some of the tribes live scattered in very
small groups&mdash;one to three families on an average. Other
tribes live in much larger groups, but these are by no
means promiscuous and undivided hordes. There are
camp rules, which point to the isolation of the family
within the local group; and customary rules for the
arrangement of individuals within the family, round camp
fires and at meals, etc. These rules and the isolation of
families are reported especially from the South-Eastern
tribes, where we may perhaps assume that the local groups
are more numerous. So that over the whole continent
the lowest unit of the tribal structure appears to be
the individual family.</p>

<p>After a long digression on the concept of family
<span class="pb" id="Pg299">[299]</span>
kinship,<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor" title="As this chapter is of a more theoretical character, it is omitted in this summary, where, on the whole, only actual facts and results are dealt with. The reader is referred to the conclusions and summaries of the said chapter (pp. 198 and 232).">[960]</a> the facts illustrating the relation between children
and parents were surveyed. It was found that the characteristic
features of this relationship are parental love
and attachment of both father and mother to their children.
The close tie between mother and child is set up by the fact
of the first cares, suckling and carrying the child. The
father is, as a rule, also extremely fond of his children; his
relation to them is by no means characterized by any legal
authority or tyrannical power, but by his affection. The
father as well as the mother treat children of both sexes
with extreme leniency, and give them some rudiments of
education. Attention was drawn to the fact that the
common attachment and extreme fondness of both
parents for their children must constitute a strong bond
of union between husband and wife. The family unit is
nevertheless restricted to parents and children under the
age of puberty. For although the ties between parents
and children last throughout life, still after reaching
puberty the children enter into new relationships, which
superimpose themselves on the former ones. These new
bonds result for the girl from marriage, for the boy from
his entering into the tribal secret society (initiation and
life in the bachelors' camp).</p>

<p>The discussion of the economic facts shows that the
sexual division of labour is considerably developed; that
the man's and the woman's share in the maintenance of
the household is quite well defined and diverse. Further
we find that the woman's work is of first-rate importance
for the economic unity and subsistence of the household.</p>

<p>The careful survey of the facts has led to some conclusions
which may be pointed out. Thus, for example,
we have been driven to the conclusion that, in considering
marriage, the importance of the sexual facts ought not to
be exaggerated. In the majority of tribes sexual facts
do not seem to play any part in the formation of bonds
<span class="pb" id="Pg300">[300]</span>
of kinship. Ideas of consanguinity are absent in these
tribes,<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor" title="Compare above, Chap. VI., esp. pp. 182, 209 sqq. and 226.">[961]</a> and herewith the sexual relations between husband
and wife lose their chief influence upon the unity
of the family. On the other hand, the sexual rights
of the husband, although very well determined, are so
often crossed by other customs that <em>exclusive</em> access to
a woman must not be made a part of the sociological
definition of marriage. The importance of the economic
features of family life, and of the common affection for
children, is much more in the foreground.</p>

<p>Stress has been laid throughout the investigation on the
importance of bearing in mind the connection of our
special problem with the general structure of society.
As said above, each conclusion has been submitted to a
kind of test as to whether it stands in agreement or in
contradiction with well-established general facts. The
main points in which the dependence of the individual
family upon social facts has been traced were the connection
of the individual family with the territorial and
tribal structure, the mode in which land ownership in
some cases distinguishes the family as a unit, the influence
of economic communism upon the economics of the
individual family, etc. But the manner in which society
most directly influences any institution lies in the various
norms, moral, customary or legal, by which society regulates
different aspects of the given institution. The
importance of such social rules is emphatically affirmed
by Prof. Durkheim: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Une communauté de fait entre des
consanguins qui se sont arrangés pour vivre ensemble,
mais sans qu'aucun d'eux soit tenu à des obligations
déterminées envers les autres et d'où chacun peut se
retirer à volonté, ne constitue pas une famille.... Pour
qu'il y ait famille, il n'est pas nécessaire qu'il y ait
cohabitation et il n'est pas suffisant qu'il y ait consanguinité.
Mais il faut de plus ... qu'il y ait des droits
et des devoirs, sanctionnés par la société, et qui unissent
les members dont la famille est composée.... La famille
<span class="pb" id="Pg301">[301]</span>
n'existe qu'autant qu'elle est une institution sociale, à
la fois juridique et morale, placée sous la sauvegarde de
la collectivité ambiante."</span><a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor" title="A.S., i. pp. 329, 330.">[962]</a> Although this opinion is
certainly exaggerated,<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor" title="Because 'cohabitation,' community of life, is one of the essential constituents of the family. Besides, there cannot exist a 'communauté de fait'; a social group cannot exist without the sanction of the surrounding society, and this creates obligations between the members of the group.">[963]</a> it quite rightly lays stress on the
importance of the social regulation of the individual family.<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor" title="We obviously cannot agree with Prof. Durkheim when he says further (loc. cit., p. 331), speaking of the Australian family: 'Ce sont des associations de fait, non de droit. Elles dépendent du gré des particuliers, se forment comme elles veulent, sans être tenues de s'astreindre à aucune norme préalable.' The Australian family is not a casual but a legal association, for it does not depend upon the whim of individuals; neither is it formed when and how they choose. ...">[964]</a></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="Pg302">[302]</span>
The importance of such norms, and especially of the
legal ones, clearly appeared in the foregoing investigation.
In order adequately to discuss this matter, the exact
sense in which the concepts of <em>law</em> and <em>legal</em> may be used
was defined, and the legal organization in Australia was
sketched. Furthermore, in all the questions discussed
we have tried to ascertain whether there are any norms
sanctioned by society, and what form this social enforcement
assumes in any given case. And here it appears that
nearly all sides of family life, far from being left to follow
their own course, are more or less subject to definite norms
of moral, customary or legal character. It was possible to
establish beyond doubt the legal aspect of marriage by
analyzing the modes of contracting marriage, and the duties
of the widow, as shown in the mourning ceremonies. The
relation between husband and wife, although characterized
by a very extensive authority of the former, has
nevertheless its legal basis. For the husband's authority
is limited to a certain extent by exterior factors (tribal
government, woman's kin) and must conform to certain
norms (he has the right to punish her for certain crimes in
a definite way); and he acquires his authority in a legal
way (by a legal marriage contract). Sexual matters
in general, and the sexual rights of the husband are well
defined and regulated. Customary (or legal) rules govern
the mode of living of a family, the distribution of food
within the family, the sexual division of labour. The
relation between parents and children, and especially
the paternal authority, hardly presented any legal aspect.
But on the whole it appears perfectly legitimate and
necessary to define the individual family in Australia as
a legal one, inasmuch as very many aspects of this institution
are subject to legal norms. And, it would be
completely erroneous to call, with Prof. Durkheim, these
units <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"agrégat de fait, sans liens de droit, désapprouvé
même le plus souvent par la loi et par l'opinion."</span><a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor" title="A.S., i. p. 330.">[965]</a></p>

<p>There is yet another point in Australian sociology most
<span class="pb" id="Pg303">[303]</span>
intimately connected with the individual family. I mean
the other forms of kinship organization: the exogamy
class, the totemic clan, possibly also the other divisions
reported by Mr. R. H. Mathews and Mrs. Parker
("blood" and "shed" divisions, etc.). And on this
point the present study is obviously incomplete, as it
neither clearly fixes the line of demarcation between the
individual and the group kinship, nor solves any of the
difficulties and contradictions indicated at the outset. A
few words must be said here in order to avoid misunderstandings.
If in any society there exist two institutions
of very close resemblance, as in Australia, the individual
family creating individual relationship and the various
kinship organizations creating group relationship, the only
way to understand their working is by describing minutely
the social functions of each of them. This has been done
for the individual family in the foregoing pages; it remains
to be done for the kinship groups.<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor" title="The writer hopes to return to this subject on another occasion. The material for the description of social functions of the exogamous class and totemic clan is comparatively scanty, although so much has been written on this subject.">[966]</a></p>

<p>Social institutions should in the first place be defined
by their social functions; if the functions&mdash;religious,
magical, legal, economic, etc.&mdash;of the totemic class, the
exogamous class, and other divisions be known and
compared with the functions of the individual family,
each of these institutions will appear as occupying a
definite place in the social organization, and playing
a determinate part in the life of the community. And
such a knowledge would afford a firm basis for further
speculations.</p>

<p>In the foregoing investigations we have omitted this
side of the problem partly in order to avoid increasing
the bulk of the monograph, but above all, that we might
develop more clearly the features of the institution
described.</p>

<p>The individual family was shown to be a unit
playing an important part in the social life of the natives
<span class="pb" id="Pg304">[304]</span>
and well defined by a number of moral, customary and
legal norms; it is further determined by the sexual
division of labour, the aboriginal mode of living, and
especially by the intimate relation between the parents
and children. The individual relation between husband
and wife (marriage) is rooted in the unity of the family.
Moreover, it is expressed by a series of facts connected
with the modes in which marriage is brought about and
in the well-defined, although not always exclusive, sexual
right the husband acquires over his wife.</p>

<h2>ADDENDA<span class="pb" id="Pg305">[305]</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Several points omitted in the body of this book, as well as a
few works and passages of special importance, which I noted
whilst reading the proofs, may be mentioned shortly in this place.
I read the book of Mr. Crawley (<cite>Mystic Rose</cite>) unfortunately after
the foregoing pages were in type; my study would have been
more complete had I known it before. Mr. Crawley analyzes the
psychology underlying human relations (those of sex in particular)
from their religious side. Primitive man is full of apprehension
of the mutual danger inherent in social and especially in sexual
contact. Hence the different systems of <em>taboo</em>; the sexual taboo
being one of the most important. To establish harmless relations
between people of different sexes requires a system of <em>breaking
the taboo</em>.</p>

<p>The ceremonies and rites of marriage are treated in the <cite>Mystic
Rose</cite> from this point of view (removal of taboo). In my opinion
this book is of great sociological importance chiefly because it
shows that the sexual act must be treated in its bearing upon
social forms, not as a simple physiological fact, but as a phenomenon
complex both in its sociological and psychological aspects.
For "savages" in particular it is surrounded by a network of
magico-religious ideas, apprehensions and emotions, resulting in
a system of rites, customs and institutions, which never can be
comprehended without reference to the underlying psychology.
It follows as an important consequence that everything connected
with matters of sex is an object of well-defined rules and laws
(compare the passage above, <a href="#Pg123">p. 123</a>, where the same has been
pointed out with reference to the Australians).</p>

<p>Another important result of Mr. Crawley's work is the establishment
of the principle that marriage rites, being the breaking of a
dangerous taboo, are an essential part of marriage, and therefore
their study is essential for the understanding of this institution.
The rites, being exclusively intended to break the taboo between
two individuals and not between two groups, lead to individual
marriage and family, and not to "group marriage" and "group
family."</p>

<p>Mr. Crawley's book is full of valuable remarks, some of which
must be quoted in the following paragraphs. I complete also
the information on several points by the addition of statements
from Mr. Roth's <cite>North Queensland Ethnography</cite> (<cite>Bull.</cite> 9 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>),
which I have only recently been able to peruse.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg27">Pp. 27-29</a>. <em>Methodic presentation of evidence.</em> As in summing up
the evidence the number of statements supporting one view or
another has been adduced sometimes by way of illustration, it
<span class="pb" id="Pg306">[306]</span>
is necessary to say explicitly what is considered to be a <em>unit of
information</em> (or an <em>individual statement</em>). I consider as independent
statements: (1) Observations of different ethnographers.
(2) Observations of the same author made on different tribes,
provided that the author has pointed out the differences and that
they are substantial enough. It seems hardly necessary to
emphasize that the numeric treatment of statements has no
pretentions to be a "statistic method of presenting evidence."
It is meant only as a convenient and clear way of summarizing
evidence.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg35">P. 35</a> and Chap. <a href="#Pg234">VII</a>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">passim</i>. <em>Mystic.</em> By this word I understand

tribes, religious and magical.</em> Compare Crawley (<cite>M.R.</cite>, p. 347).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg48">P. 48</a>. <em>Betrothal</em> is prevalent all over the tribes of North
Queensland (Roth, <cite>Bull.</cite> 10, pp. 3-7, §§ 6-14). Among the tribes
of Pennefather River (§ 6) it is effected during the infancy of the
female and it is invariably adhered to. In the hinterland of Princess
Charlotte Bay the bridegroom has to visit his fiancée before
marriage for several weeks (§ 7). Infant betrothal is rare among
the natives of Cape Bedford (§ 8). On the Bloomfield River
female children are betrothed at birth (§ 10). Infant betrothal
obtains also among the Cape Grafton and Tully River natives
(§§ 11, 12). A betrothal ceremony (recalling that of the Euahlayi
tribe, see above, <a href="#Pg40">p. 40</a>) held when a girl is about three years old
is described with reference to the Torilla and Pine Mountain
Blacks (§ 13). There are an elaborate ceremonial, taboos and
duties connected with betrothal in all these tribes. In the North-West
tribes betrothal is generally known (§ 14).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg50">Pp. 50-52</a>. <em>Marriage gifts.</em> In the Pennefather River tribes
a man is bound to supply his fiancée's parents with gifts (food,
arms, etc.) (<cite>Bull.</cite> 10, § 6). Presents form an important feature of
the marriage contract among the natives of Princess Charlotte
Bay (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</i>, § 7). The same is reported about the tribes of
Normanby River (§ 9), Bloomfield River (§ 10), Torilla and Pine
Mountain (§ 12).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg52">P. 52</a>. <em>Publicity of marriage and betrothal</em> is mentioned by Roth
among the natives of Pennefather River (<cite>Bull.</cite> 10, § 6) and Bloomfield
River (§ 10). There is a public ceremonial sign for marriage
("building of a hut and lighting of a fire" by the girl) common
to all tribes (§ 5).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg52">P. 52</a>. <em>Marriage ceremonies more prevalent than appears from
evidence.</em> To corroborate my supposition that marriage ceremonies
are much more frequent in Australia than stated by the
authorities I may quote Mr. Crawley's view. He says that "as
to those (peoples) who are said to possess no marriage ceremony, it
will generally be found that there is some act performed which is
too slight or too practical to be marked by an observer as a
'ceremony,' but which when analyzed turns out to be a real
marriage rite." And as an example the author quotes two forms
of marriage ceremony among the tribes of Central Australia
(<cite>Mystic Rose</cite>, p. 318).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg52">Pp. 52</a>, <a href="#Pg53">53</a>. <em>Marriage ceremonies</em> are reported by Roth with
<span class="pb" id="Pg307">[307]</span>
reference to all tribes of Northern Queensland (<cite>Bull.</cite> 10, "Marriage
Ceremonies," etc., especially §§ 1-19). In § 5 a public ceremonial
sign of marriage common to all these tribes is described; in §§ 9,
13 and 15, such ceremonies in different tribes are given with
details. Ceremonial sexual intercourse with other men before
marriage is mentioned in § 20.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg56">Pp. 56-58</a>. <em>Legal aspect of marriage.</em> The different social
conditions enumerated by Roth (<cite>Bull.</cite> 10, §§ 1, 2 and 3) are a
valuable addition to our knowledge of the legal aspect of marriage.
"Essentials of marriage before it can be publicly recognized"
are: membership in suitable exogamous groups, absence of
intimate consanguinity and a suitable social status. If these
conditions are not fulfilled the community either violently break
the match, or by ridicule, plots, etc., will take an action "usually
quite sufficient to cause a separation" (§1, p. 2).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg61">P. 61</a>. <em>Ideas embodied in marriage ceremonies.</em> In the survey
of various marriage ceremonies Mr. Crawley first enumerates
those in which the aspect of <em>breaking the taboo</em>, of securing
immunity from danger, dominates (<cite>M.R.</cite>, pp. 322-370); then
come those in which the magical and religious elements "actually
and materially uniting the man and woman" are prominent
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, pp. 370-390). This aspect corresponds to what I have
expressed above emphasizing that marriage is a "sacrament"
(<a href="#Pg61">p. 61</a>). Very important is the analogy between marriage rites
and love charms which Mr. Crawley points out; the same has
been said above (<a href="#Pg41">p. 41</a>), where it was pointed out that the
Arunta love charm has its legal (=binding) aspect. Mr. Crawley
lays emphasis on the fact that all marriage ceremonies and rites
possess an <em>individualistic</em> character (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, pp. 320 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>). They
refer always to individuals and not to groups, and all their
magical, religious (I would add <em>legal</em>) consequences refer to the
two individuals concerned and not to two groups.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg63">P. 63</a>. <em>Polygyny.</em> Although this fact had no special theoretical
bearing in any of my arguments, still it seems advisable to state
it here explicitly and with references for the sake of completeness.
Polygyny seems to be restricted to the old and influential men,
and to be rather an exception, although it seems to be found in all
tribes. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cf.</i> Curr, <cite>A.R.</cite>, i. pp. 106, 107, 110 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>; Br. Smyth,

Roth, <cite>Bull.</cite> 10, p. 12; Tom Petrie, p. 61; Brown, p. 450;
Salvado, p. 278. Compare besides Westermarck, <cite>H.H.M.</cite>,
p. 440, and the references given there.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg63">Pp. 63</a>, <a href="#Pg64">64</a>. <em>Levirate.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cf.</i> Westermarck, <cite>H.H.M.</cite>, p. 510, for
Australian references and for the exposition and criticism of
different theories concerning this custom.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg64">Pp. 64-66</a>. <em>Divorce</em> is mentioned by Roth (<cite>Bull.</cite> 10, pp. 11,
12). Usually the man repudiates or gives away his wife.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg82">Pp. 82-84</a>. <em>Marital affection.</em> Mutual attachment and love
between man and wife is stated explicitly by Roth (<cite>Bull.</cite> 10, § 17).
It plays an important part in marriage arrangements (marriage
<span class="pb" id="Pg308">[308]</span>
by elopement). That love must be prevalent among the Australian
savages is shown also by the different love charms they possess.
(Compare, for instance, above, p. 41, <a href="#Footnote_85">footnote 9</a>).&mdash;Compare
Westermarck, <em>H.H.M.</em>, p. 359, where Australian references are
given, and Chap. XVI. pp. 356 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>, where the problem in
general is discussed.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg84">Pp. 84-88</a>. <em>Mourning and burial.</em> In Roth, <cite>Bull.</cite> 9, pp. 366,
367, we read that only after the elaborate mourning and burial
ceremonies have been finished and the dead man's spirit appeased
and got rid of, is the widow allowed to remarry. On pp. 394, 396
and 402, we read that the widow and widower have the greatest
share in these ceremonies. P. 381 recounts the severe ordeals
that a widow and widower have to undergo. Unfortunately it
it impossible to enter here into the many details given by Roth
which strongly confirm the views expressed above, in <a href="#Pg67">Chap. III</a>.
From the description of mourning and burial customs among
some tribes of New South Wales, given by Mr. R. H. Mathews,
it appears that the widow has long and toilsome mourning duties;
she is specially adorned, she may not go out hunting, and has to
chant customary lamentation for several months (<cite>Eth. Notes</cite>,
pp. 71, 72).</p>

<p>P. 93, <a href="#Footnote_242">footnote 4</a> and <a href="#Pg107">p. 107</a>. <em>Incest.</em> Roth affirms that incest
is absolutely never perpetrated in the North Queensland
tribes (<cite>Bull.</cite> 10, pp. 2, 3).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg108">Pp. 108-123</a>. <em>Pirrauru not a group marriage.</em> Mr. A. Lang
gives an excellent criticism of the view that <i>Pirrauru</i> is a survival
of ancient promiscuity. Still less tenable, of course, is the view
that it is actual group marriage. Lang, <cite>The Secret of the Totem</cite>,
Chap. III.&mdash;A similar view has been expounded by Mr. Crawley,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, pp. 475-483.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg168">Pp. 168</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i> <em>Necessity of adapting sociological concepts to the
social and psychological conditions of the given society.</em> "It is
only in early modes of thought that we can find the explanation
of ceremonies and systems which originated in primitive society;
and, if ceremony and system are the concrete forms in which
human relations are expressed, an examination, ethnological
and psychological, of human relations is indispensable for inquiry
into human institutions." And, speaking of some previous
inquiries into human kinship, the same author adds: "They have
interpreted primitive custom by ideas which are far from primitive,
which, in fact, are relatively late and belong to the legal
stage of human culture. The attribution of legal conceptions to
primitive thought has had the usual effect of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> theory, and
has checked inquiry" (Crawley, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 1). The second
phrase covers in particular the views expounded above, <a href="#Pg185">pp. 185</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i></p>

<p><a href="#Pg170">P. 170</a>. <em>Social factors of kinship.</em> "Habitual proximity and
contact is the strongest and most ordinary tie, and is earlier in
thought than the tie of blood" (Crawley, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 452).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg175">P. 175</a>. <em>Collective mind.</em> This expression does not postulate
the existence of any metaphysical entity&mdash;any mysterious spiritual
medium, independent of any human brains. Of course every
psychological process takes place in an individual mind. This
term is an abbreviation for denoting the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</i> of "collective
<span class="pb" id="Pg309">[309]</span>
ideas" and "collective feelings." And by these are expressed
such mental facts as are peculiar to a certain society, and at the
same time embodied in and expressed by its institutions. For
sociological purposes psychological facts must be treated from a
special point of view, and, to emphasize <em>that</em>, the adjective "collective"
seems appropriate. Compare p. 192, <a href="#Footnote_556">footnote 1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg179">Pp. 179-182</a>. <em>Absence of social consanguinity in primitive
societies.</em> "The strong conception of the tie of blood, best seen in
feudal and semi-civilized societies, is by no means so strong in
primitive culture" (Crawley, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 451).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg183">P. 183</a>. <em>The meaning of "kinship" ought not to be restricted
to any special set of ideas.</em> "'Kinship' in primitive thought is
a vaguer term than in later culture ... because the tie of
blood had not attained prominence over looser ties of contact"
(Crawley, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 451).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg183">Pp. 183</a>, <a href="#Pg184">184</a>. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Couvade.</i> An extensive bibliography on this
subject is forthcoming in <cite>Zeitschr. f. Ethnol.</cite> Band 43. Heft iii.
and iv., pp. 560-63. Berlin, 1911.</p>

<p><a href="#Pg260">Pp. 260-262</a>. <em>Young females monopolized by old men.</em> Besides
the statements set forth in the text, I find three more collected
by Prof. Webster referring to the Queenslanders (Lumholtz),
to the West Australians (Frogatt), and to the Australians in
general (J. Matthew) (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, pp. 70, 71). Among the tribes of
Northern Queensland infant betrothal widely prevails; "the old
men usually getting the pick" (Roth, <cite>Bull.</cite> 10, pp. 3-7).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg262">Pp. 262</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i> The <em>bachelors' camp</em> is mentioned by Roth
(<cite>Bull.</cite> 10, p. 4).</p>

<p><a href="#Pg272">Pp. 272</a>, <a href="#Pg273">273</a>. <em>Relations between brothers and sisters.</em> Mr. Crawley
has shown that avoidance between brother and sister, rooted in
apprehensions of mutual danger is the rule among savages.
This is <ins id="C309" title="corrobated">corroborated</ins> by the scanty Australian evidence we possess.
(See <cite>M.R.</cite>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">passim</i>; for references see Index under "Brother and
Sister").</p>

<p><a href="#Pg283">Pp. 283-286</a>. <em>Communism in food.</em> An interesting statement
of an old explorer concerning the aboriginal communism in food
may be adduced here. It refers to the North-Western blacks.
"Be it little or much that they get, every one has his part, as well
the young and tender as the old and feeble, who are not able to
go abroad, as the strong and lusty" (Dampier, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 103).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> In the treatises on primitive law and on family law such
general concepts as "legal" or "law" are never explicitly defined.
Perhaps such a definition is superfluous for a specialist, but I
think that especially in the ethnology of primitive peoples precise
concepts and explicit definitions are necessary. I may, however,
mention the following places where there are some attempts at
definition&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Post</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.c.</i>, i. sec. 3, pp. 8-10. The author gives a few remarks
about the beginnings of law. He maintains it existed as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rechtsgefühl</i>,
feeling of legality, and was evolved through a system of
juridical verdicts, given according to this sentiment. There
were no legal norms at the beginning.&mdash;This passage is unsatisfactory,
both because it does not give any strict definition and
because it does not seem to be in agreement with the facts.</p>

<p><i>Kohler</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.c.</i>, p. 323. No strict definition given. Besides the
author says that there is no organization (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">staatliche Organisation</i>),
no tribunal, and no executive among the Australian aborigines.
This assertion may be questioned; compare below.</p>

<p><i>Durkheim, D.T.S.</i>, pp. 28 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i> and 108 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i> There are some
interesting remarks bearing upon our subject; but there are no
sufficiently clear definitions, especially none to suit the laws of
quite primitive peoples.</p>

<p><i>Lord Avebury</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.c.</i>, chap. xi. pp. 464 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i> No definition of
what "law," "legal," should mean in very low societies, attempted.
Law and custom are not discriminated. Some
interesting remarks on punishment (pp. 495 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>) are not utilized
in order to afford strict concepts.</p></div>

p. 282. And especially <cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>, chap. vi. pp. 295-354. The
elucidation of the problem of authority and justice in Australia
is one of Howitt's chief merits. In the passages quoted, there will
be found ample material to exemplify all that is said in the text.
I shall give, however, a few more detailed references on some
special points. Howitt does not classify the facts according to
the principle just enunciated. But all he says fits perfectly well
into our scheme, and he puts stress on some essential points;
viz. that there is a tribal as well as a supernatural punishment;
that there is a central authority, and that it had means to enforce
and execute its decrees. Curr (<cite>A.R.</cite>, vol. i. pp. 53 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>) emphatically
denies the existence of any kind of government; but his
polemic is due to the misunderstanding of the word <em>government</em>
as it should be applied to the Australian aboriginal society. For
general discussion of this problem compare also G. C. Wheeler,
pp. 46-52. Interesting details, corroborating Howitt's opinion
may be found also in the following places: Spencer and Gillen,

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> Chiefs are reported by Taplin (Woods, p. 32); J. Dawson,
pp. 5 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i> But these statements, especially the latter, seem
subject to doubt. Compare Curr, <cite>A.R.</cite>, i. pp. 55 and 58. Howitt
and his correspondents report chiefs among the Dieri, Tongaranka,
Wiimbaio, Theddora, Yuin, Wiradjuri, Gurnditch Mara, Kulin,
etc., <cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>, pp. 297-320. Compare also Waitz Gerland, p. 790.
But the term "Chief" appears somewhat vague; probably it is
usually applied to influential individuals, whose importance is due
to their personal qualities and not to their social position. The
influence of old men, magicians and "doctors," is almost
universally reported, and the council made up of them seems to
wield the real power in the tribe. Compare Howitt, <cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>,
pp. 320-326, for some of the above references.</p></div>

kinds of food taboos. In the Arunta, food procured or handled
by certain relatives may not be eaten by a man; nor may be
eaten any food in their immediate presence. Such food would
disagree with the man. Spencer and Gillen, <cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>, p. 469.&mdash;If
certain food taboos were transgressed during initiation by the
boys, their wounds would inflame. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</i> p. 470.&mdash;Certain taboos
must be observed during pregnancy both by the woman and her
husband; if they were transgressed the sickness of the woman
would be worse and the man would lose his skill in hunting.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</i> p. 471.&mdash;Compare also Mitchell, ii. p. 29, and Wilhelmi,
p. 176. If the man should transgress the mother-in-law taboo,
his hair would prematurely grow grey, or he would soon become
bald. This belief is very widespread. Howitt, <cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>, p. 296.
D. Mathews, p. 49. Mrs. Bates, p. 50. Compare also Waitz
Gerland, p. 795, where different norms, enforced by supernatural
punishment, are mentioned, and also MacGillivray, ii. 10, Eyre
ii. 339, Stanbridge, p. 289. Different ceremonies and ordeals at
mourning and burial are regulated by <em>custom</em>; the same thing
may probably be said of some of the initiatory ordeals. Noncompliance
would involve the general ridicule or contempt of the
tribesmen: Spencer and Gillen, <cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>, p. 510. As <em>crimes</em> may
be mentioned: transgression of the class rule as well in marriage
as in sexual intercourse. Spencer and Gillen, <cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>, p. 495, say
that the usual punishment is death. Killing by magic: Spencer
and Gillen, p. 476; Waitz Gerland, p. 794. In some cases the transgression
of the mother-in-law taboo seems to be punished by
expulsion from the local group: Howitt, <cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>, p. 296.&mdash;Salvado
says that marriage under thirty years is punished by
death (p. 267). Such examples could be indefinitely multiplied.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> The ethnographic sources do not differ essentially from the
historical ones. The purpose of a descriptive ethnography (such
as is adopted in this monograph) is also nearly identical with the
historian's task so far as positive statement of an actual state of
things is the aim of both. The rules of criticism of sources apply
therefore to our subject as well as to any other historic science.
This will become obvious to every ethnographer who reads the
excellent manual of MM. Langlois et Seignobos. The proof of
the indispensability of such a criticism is to be found there, too.
The method of criticism of sources adopted in this paper was
accepted after a careful study of this useful book.</p></div>

have arisen had any one attempted to come into more
intimate contact with them. But in the early days of the settlement
of Australia there was nobody with such intentions. It is
sufficient to read very early accounts, such as the voyages of
Gov. Phillip, Barrington; as also accounts of explorers like
Grey, Eyre, Leichardt, Mitchell, Sturt, etc., to see how shy and
inaccessible were the blacks in their really savage state.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> As far as I see, in the present state of our knowledge, it is
only admissible to speak with greatest care and in very broad
lines of the Australian types of culture. Interesting attempts
have been made in this direction by Dr. Graebner, Mr. N. W.
Thomas, and Father Schmidt. The two latter especially base
their work on a profound and extensive knowledge, and formulate
their results with the utmost reserve and carefulness. Fr. W.
Schmidt has at his disposal the powerful instrument of linguistic
knowledge. Mr. W. N. Thomas knows the Australian facts as
nobody else does. Their conclusions are therefore of much
weight. The present investigations afford little opportunity to
point out geographic differences. Compare Fr. W. Schmidt, "Die
Stellung, d. Aranda," etc., <cite>Z.f.E.</cite>, 1908, pp. 866 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>; F. Graebner,

any difficulty in finding a relative for exchange, or if two people

custom and law, but it was a valid, recognized form of marriage if

exchange of a female relative, with the alternative possibility of
obtaining one by inheritance (Levirate), by elopement, or by
capture."&mdash;<cite>Trans. R.S.V.</cite>, p. 115.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_206" id="Footnote_206" href="#FNanchor_206" class="label">[206]</a> Illustrating this point is a passage in Nieboer's <cite>Slavery</cite>
(pp. 9 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>) bearing very closely on our subject. His aim is to
discuss whether the position of the wife in Australia may be
characterized as slavery. He arranges the evidence in two
contrasting sets: in the first he gathers all shadows of the picture,
in the second the bright spots. So he adduces several instances
which show that the girl has no voice in the choice of her husband;
and, on the other hand, he shows that from a series of other
statements it may be inferred that the girl often marries according
to her feelings. (In our discussion of the modes of obtaining
wives, we saw that when betrothed normally, by engagement in
infancy, neither the girl nor, practically, her husband choose in
the true sense of the word. Whereas marriage by elopement is
brought about by mutual consent. These two forms of marriage
would correspond therefore to Nieboer's two contradictory
series.) Under the second heading, Nieboer gathers statements
as to barbarous treatment and want of affection on one hand,
and of affection and rights of the woman on the other. Under
the third heading the economic duties and the importance of the
woman are discussed, one set of information exaggerating it, the
other reducing it to small proportions (we shall treat this subject
beneath). Nieboer's computation is very interesting as an
illustration of how one can prove <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contra</i> from ethnographical
material, even while confining oneself to a limited area
and subject. All the series of statements collected in this book
are further examples of the same fact. As a result of his discussion,
Nieboer dismisses of course the term "slave" used by
many writers to designate the woman's position in Australia.</p></div>

a revision of the concept of <em>survival</em>, in order to avoid arbitrariness
when classifying one custom as a survival, another as an
innovation. I venture to say such classifications have been made
too carelessly. I think it will be clear from the whole of this
book, that the individual family should not be considered as a
mere innovation, and that, accordingly, there is hardly any justification
for treating the customs in question as survivals. But
this is only by way of parenthesis; these problems lie outside
our task. They must be treated on a broader basis than that
of the Australian ethnographic area only.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_310" id="Footnote_310" href="#FNanchor_310" class="label">[310]</a> For a detailed enumeration and description of all tribes
among whom practices of the <i>Pirrauru</i> type exist, see Howitt,
<cite>J.A.I.</cite>, xx. pp. 31-34. In this article, which is nearly exactly
reproduced in Howitt's last work (<cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>), we possess, undoubtedly,
the best information about the <i>Pirrauru</i> custom.
In another place (<cite>Folk-Lore</cite>, xviii. p. 184), Howitt assigns a still
wider area to the <i>Pirrauru</i> practice. "Altogether, Dr. Howitt
reckons that the tribes which practised a form of group marriage
like the <i>Pirrauru</i> of the Dieri must have occupied an area of
some 500,000 square miles, extending for a distance of 850 miles
from Oodnadatta, the northern boundary of the Urabunna, to
the eastern frontier of the Dieri, or of the Mardala tribe between
the Flinders Range and the Barrier Range."&mdash;Frazer, <cite>Tot. and
Exog.</cite>, i. p. 371.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_311" id="Footnote_311" href="#FNanchor_311" class="label">[311]</a> We have reasons to doubt whether these authors were as
well informed about the Urabunna tribe as about the Arunta
nation. Anyhow, the information they give about the <i>Piraungaru</i>
custom is much inferior as well in respect of quantity as quality
(the inconsistency of their statement is shown above) than that
about the Arunta, and the conclusions they draw therefrom are
not quite in accord with the facts as they relate them (see below,
<a href="#Pg118">p. 118</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_312" id="Footnote_312" href="#FNanchor_312" class="label">[312]</a> <cite>J.A.I.</cite>, xx. p. 53, <cite>Smith. Rep.</cite>, p. 807, <cite>Trans. R.S.V.</cite>,
p. 100. In <cite>J.A.I.</cite>, xx. p. 53, Howitt says that among all these
tribes there are two forms of marriage. "There is a marriage ...
which may be spoken of as 'individual marriage.'" "There is
also a marital relation existing between a man and a number of
women, or between a woman and number of men. This latter
connection may be spoken of as group marriage." We see that
Howitt uses here the word "marriage" only to design the
individual union, and speaking about the <i>Pirrauru</i>, correctly
employs the words "marital relations." This sounds quite
differently from the repeated denial that the "individual marriage
does not exist in the tribes" made by Spencer and Gillen
(<cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>, pp. 63, 109; <cite>Nor. Tr.</cite>, p. 140). And again Howitt says
(<cite>Trans. R.S.V.</cite>, p. 115), "Individual marriage in Australian tribes
has been evident to every one, but beside it exist also group
marriages."</p></div>

the surface if he does not discuss the phenomena and theorize
on them. On the other hand such speculations, if carried on by
the untrained faculties and unaided efforts of the writers, or

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_346" id="Footnote_346" href="#FNanchor_346" class="label">[346]</a> This expression is perhaps inexact. But this is not the place
for psychological and biological analyses. The reader may be
referred to Dr. Westermarck's conclusion that there is a strong
instinct of sexual jealousy among primitive races of men, both
in males (<cite>H.H.M.</cite>, pp. 117-132) and in females (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</i>, pp. 495-500).
This instinct is inherited from our animal ancestors (compare
Darwin, <cite>Descent of Man</cite>, ii. p. 395). Important for us are
the examples of female jealousy, quoted by Westermarck from the
Australian material; Narrinyeri, Taplin, p. 11; Palmer, p. 282;
Lumholtz, p. 213; Waitz Gerland, pp. 758, 781.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_348" id="Footnote_348" href="#FNanchor_348" class="label">[348]</a> Custom referring to a certain point&mdash;here <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i> to the
question whether it is honourable or ignominious to waive one's
marital rights&mdash;stands in the relation of correspondence to the
collective ideas and collective feelings on this point. The expression
of Spencer and Gillen that the feeling of jealousy is
"subservient to that of the influence of tribal custom" is therefore
incorrect (<cite>Nat. Tr.</cite>, p. 99). It would be obviously quite
erroneous to assert that there is any collective feeling which
would not be subservient to the tribal custom. It is consequently
meaningless to affirm that the given feeling here is subservient.
We may, therefore, discard also the logical conclusion at which
Messrs. Spencer and Gillen arrive from these premisses: viz.
that jealousy is a matter of no importance when dealing with the
Central Australians (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</i>, p. 100). A certain tribal or national
custom expresses or formulates public feelings, and, on the other
hand, if there is a certain type of collective feelings or ideas,
they must have their legal or customary forms wherein to express
themselves. We should say: the Australian customs show that
there is no such collective feeling as jealousy in our sense, which
would obviously object to such customs as theirs. The collective
feelings in Australia which correspond to our jealousy do not
imply, therefore, the idea of absolute exclusiveness; the idea
of inviolable personal access of a man to a woman does not
exist there; that is proved by the custom in question. But outside
the limits prescribed by tribal custom there is little adultery;
jealousy seems to be exceedingly strong, and the same tribal
law, which in some cases compels the man to give up his marital
rights, in other cases justifies him in the utmost brutalities, and
allows him even to inflict death with impunity upon his wife.
Owing to the scantiness of our information we can hardly say
whether sexual jealousy is stronger or weaker in Australian than
in other societies; we can safely affirm that it is different.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_354" id="Footnote_354" href="#FNanchor_354" class="label">[354]</a> "In the study of population ... the facts of aggregation

<cite>Princ. of Sociology</cite>, p. 79). In fact all the social phenomena of
higher order corresponding to differentiation and constitution
depend upon the facts of grouping. In the lowest societies, as
the Australian, the mode of living in very small groups precludes
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> the possibility of any higher social formations.
We may say that the social horizon of a community extends as
far as the contact of its members. In higher societies this
contact need not necessarily be an actual one; as a rule in more
developed communities members of a social unit (nation, town,
association) only come exceptionally and in a diminutive degree
into immediate contact. But there are innumerable ways of
mental contact. On the contrary there is no other form of
contact but the personal one among the Australian blacks, and
it is the first condition for the formation of any social bonds
amongst them. In the discussion of all kinship bonds we should
never lose sight of the fact that it is highly improbable that
people who never were in personal contact could feel more closely
related than people who usually live together.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_355" id="Footnote_355" href="#FNanchor_355" class="label">[355]</a> The importance of the aboriginal mode of living in the study
of family life and kinship bonds has been well brought out by
Dr. Westermarck (<cite>H.H.M.</cite>, pp. 42 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>, especially pp. 43-47).
His general inference&mdash;that in low societies the scattered mode
of living brings into prominence individual kinship bonds, and
isolates the family unit&mdash;will be corroborated by our conclusions
drawn from the Australian material. The few Australian
examples&mdash;quoted and interpreted by Dr. Westermarck&mdash;have
been vehemently disputed by Herr Cunow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 122, footnote).
His criticism, if compared with the data presented in
this chapter, will appear quite unfounded. Herr Cunow's book
does not, by the way, deserve its good reputation. There are
many statements in it, given without references, which I have
been unable to verify in the first hand evidence.</p></div>

that such words and expressions as "proprietor," "ownership,"
"landed property," "rights to a tract of country," etc., are not
to be taken in the sense which they possess in application to
higher societies, to our own society in particular. Their correct
meaning will be gathered from the following discussion. For the
sake of clearness and brevity it was sometimes needful, in the
text, to use the above expressions, instead of the more correct
ones like "possession," "claims to a country," etc. The term
"property" has a definite legal meaning, which makes it impossible
to apply it in its full sense to the low society with which
we are concerned.</p></div>

to this point, as it lies outside our proper field of investigation.
It may be found, more or less explicitly, in some of them (J. D.
Lang, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</i>). I mentioned it here only to give a fuller account
of all aspects under which possession of land presents itself in
Australia.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_452" id="Footnote_452" href="#FNanchor_452" class="label">[452]</a> This mystic character of some individual claims to a particular
tract of country appears also from Roth's statement, and
from a passage of Oldfield (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 252). "Every male is
bound to visit the place of his nativity three times a year." But
this writer could not ascertain the purpose of it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_453" id="Footnote_453" href="#FNanchor_453" class="label">[453]</a> Compare Grey, ii. p. 233, and the letter of G. S. Lang quoted
by him therein. It appears that both these writers were to a
certain extent inspired by a humanitarian tendency, namely to
show that the Australian aborigines were not quite without ideas
of property in land, and that they were wronged by the white
settlers, and thus deserved compensation for the loss of their
hunting-grounds. The letter mentioned was written to some
humanitarian society. We may, therefore, still more distrust
these statements. We have seen that the idea of possession of
land, of an exclusive right to use a certain tract of country, was
well known to our aborigines, but that they conceived of it as
vested in a group, not in individuals.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_454" id="Footnote_454" href="#FNanchor_454" class="label">[454]</a> It is well to remember that there cannot be drawn a sharp
line of distinction between a "family" and a "local group";
moreover, in the use of these terms our authorities are mostly
careless and indiscriminate. As to the individual possession of
land, it has been pointed out in connection with Howitt's
statement on the Wurunjerri, that the individual rights of some
influential man (headman) might be the expression of the rights
of his local group.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_456" id="Footnote_456" href="#FNanchor_456" class="label">[456]</a> Compare nearly all of our statements, especially those of
Spencer and Gillen, Howitt, Curr. Mr. Wheeler writes in his
conclusions (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 161). "Territorial conquest is never
sought, for the absolute right of the local group to its district is
fully recognized." The respect for boundaries is also stated:
in <cite>Science of Man</cite>, xi. (1910), p. 197 ("tribal" area sharply
marked; death is the punishment for trespass). <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</i> (1900),
p. 85. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</i> (1901), p. 9.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_457" id="Footnote_457" href="#FNanchor_457" class="label">[457]</a> It is impossible to enlarge here upon this interesting subject,
which would require a separate study to itself. The two volumes
of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen especially are full of facts, showing
that the tribal traditions, the totemic cult, the initiation ceremonies,
and all other magical (or religious) functions were intimately
bound up with the locality in which a local group lived.
The local group itself was, so to say, an offshoot of the local
totem centre, the <i>Oknanikilla</i>; the "spiritual parts" of its
member, closely associated each with its <i>Churinga</i>, are enshrined
in the <i>Ertnatulunga</i>. That the local group is intimately connected
with its territory is no wonder. Such a form of possession,
although it involves an extremely strong bond of union between
man and land, is evidently something quite different
from more developed forms of proprietorship.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_458" id="Footnote_458" href="#FNanchor_458" class="label">[458]</a> The difference in physical geography between the coastal
regions and the Central parts, the greater variety in the South-East
region in general, and the relations of these physiographical
features to the social features of the Australian aboriginal society,
are well brought out by Prof. Frazer in his beautifully written
chapter on Physical Geography (<cite>Tot. and <ins id="C156" title="Exeg.">Exog.</ins></cite>, chap. v. § 1, pp.
314-339). Prof. Frazer's conclusion that the coastal and South-Eastern
tribes are more advanced involves the assertion set forth
here that coastal tribes, and in general tribes living in more
fertile regions, live in more numerous, stable and permanent
aggregations. Many of the instances and quotations of Prof.
Frazer's chapter directly confirm our results, and the reader is
referred to this chapter, which reviews nearly all the geographical
differences that can be traced in Australia. That I do not agree
with Prof. Frazer's views as to group marriage, etc., and with
all his conclusions referring to prehistoric times, hardly needs
to be pointed out, and does not affect the importance for my
argument of his splendid collection and exposition of facts.
Especially the two passages from Grey, quoted by Prof. Frazer
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i>, which had escaped my attention, are very valuable.
They show that on the coast, where the soil is more fertile, the
natives lived in larger bodies.</p></div>

relationship not necessarily based upon ideas of community
of blood <em>kinship</em>, as is done here, or whether we call it <em>social</em>
in opposition to <em>physical kinship</em>, as does M. A. van Gennep.
What is essential is to point out that our peculiarly European
idea of kinship, which necessarily involves consanguinity, cannot
be applied to other societies without discussion, but that it is
only a special case of a more general concept of kinship which
may be made up of quite different elements. It would seem
convenient to reserve the word consanguinity for relationship
based upon community of blood, and to use the word kinship
to denote the parental relationship in general.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_530" id="Footnote_530" href="#FNanchor_530" class="label">[530]</a> Mr. Sidney Hartland has given an exceedingly exhaustive
collection of stories "of birth other than what we know as the
only natural cause"; of customs in which the "means to which
in these stories birth is attributed are or have been actually
adopted for the production of children"; and he has compared
this folkloristic material with the Australian beliefs. Besides
this weight of facts, the author adduces other important reasons
why it is extremely probable that "such ignorance was once
greater and more widespread than now." The book of Mr.
Sidney Hartland is undoubtedly the most thorough and most
scientific discussion of the present problem. The strength of his
arguments and the mass of evidence strongly support his conclusions.
The contrary opinion, viz. that the Australian nescience
is an accidental result of some animistic beliefs, an opinion chiefly
represented by Mr. A. Lang, seems to be based more on speculation
than on facts. The view that the ignorance of paternity
was widespread in primitive mankind is shared by Prof. Frazer,
M. A. van Gennep, and Frhr. von Reitzenstein. (For references,

doing it, and compelled to perform a series of duties and services,

we see that in our society the relation between parents and
children has much more of a legal character than in Australia.
Nevertheless it would seem quite absurd to style this relation
in our society as essentially a legal one. It has only its legal

<p><a name="Footnote_574" id="Footnote_574" href="#FNanchor_574" class="label">[574]</a> Of course I insist here only upon the logical and methodological
priority of the psychological determination of kinship
over the genealogical. In reality, wherever individual paternal
kinship exists, the genealogies may be drawn first, and they
possess an independent value, even if we did not know what is the
content of the aboriginal idea of kinship. There is a series of
highly valuable sociological conclusions that may be drawn
from a system of genealogies (compare Dr. Rivers' article on
this subject in <cite>Sociological Review</cite>, 1910, pp. 1 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>).</p>

<p>I do not, therefore, agree with the following remark of Sir
Laurence Gomme (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">op. cit.</i>, p. 232): "It is of no use preparing a
genealogical tree on the basis of civilized knowledge of genealogy
if such a document is beyond the ken of the people to whom it
relates. The information for it may be correctly collected, but if
the whole structure is not within the compass of savage thought
it is a misleading anthropological document." If it is possible at
all to collect a genealogy, that means that individual kinship exists
in such a community; in other words the "structure is within the
compass of savage thought," only it is not apprehended by them
in the same manner as by us. It is certainly true that in many
cases the knowledge of this aboriginal apprehension is essentially
needful for a sociologist. This has been argued in the text.</p></div>

Apart from the naturally somewhat loose terminology (the
passage about kinship is intended as an example only, and does
not aim at a full treatment of the subject)&mdash;the passages quoted
express the same ideas which served as a starting-point for
this chapter.</p>

<p>I came across the paragraph in question unfortunately only
after the MS. of the present chapter had been finished and
the foregoing chapters had been printed. The opinion of Sir
Laurence Gomme would also have been of value in support of
the views expressed in the Introduction, <a href="#Pg6">pp. 6</a>, <a href="#Pg7">7</a>, where I try
to show that it is meaningless to use the word "family" as
a rigidly determined concept of universal application. "The
family as seen in savage society, and the family as it appears
among the antiquities of the Indo-European people, are totally
distinct in origin, in compass and in force" (Sir Laurence Gomme,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, pp. 236, 237). And the author applies his criticism to
the same two writers who have been the objects of my attacks
(Mr. A. Lang and Mr. N. W. Thomas, see <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">op. cit.</i>, p. 236, footnote
1). And, again, Sir Laurence Gomme argues that the unqualified
use of the term "family" is very harmful, "because
of the universal application of this term to the smallest social
unit of the civilized world, and because of the fundamental
difference of structure of the units which roughly answer to the
definition of family in various parts of the world" (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">op. cit.</i>,
p. 235). Certainly there is also a <em>fundamental analogy</em> of
structure between all forms of human family; but the problem
must be set forth and it must be acknowledged that this social
unit undergoes deep changes as other elements of social structure
change.</p></div>

<p>In fact, the theory of totemic conception is so closely connected
with the whole of the aboriginal totemic beliefs that it is necessary
to be acquainted with the latter in order to understand the former;
and for this the perusal of both the works of Messrs. Spencer
and Gillen and of Strehlow is necessary.

<p>
Among the theoretical works dealing with primitive views of
conception and paternity (in Australia and in general), we must
place first the treatise of Mr. E. S. Hartland, <cite>Primitive Paternity</cite>,
which is the most extensive and thorough examination of all
beliefs, referring to a supernatural cause of birth and all its social
consequences. The beliefs in question play an important rôle
in Prof. Frazer's work on <cite>Totemism and Exogamy</cite>. See especially
vol. iv., on origins of Totemism.</p>

<p>We may mention also the works of van Gennep, <cite>Mythes et
Légendes d'Australie</cite>, especially chaps. v. and vi. of the Introduction,
pp. 44-67, in which the ignorance of the natives is illustrated
by several interesting remarks and inferences from other facts
(for example, the beliefs of the aborigines about the rôle and
nature of the sexual organs, pp. 111 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>). Compare also the
article of Frhr. v. Reitzenstein, <cite>Z.f.E.</cite>, xli., pp. 644 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i> Mr. A.

the Rev. L. Schultze's statement. Mrs. Parker quotes also beliefs

amongst the Central and even all the other Australian tribes
(<cite>Trans. R.S.N.S.W.</cite>, 1906, xi. pp. 110 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>). He says: "In all
aboriginal tribes there is a deeply-seated belief in the reincarnation
of their ancestors." And he gives illustrations of this belief
among the Arunta. Mr. Mathews also draws attention to a
series of analogous statements from older authors (Taplin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc.

<p><a name="Footnote_624" id="Footnote_624" href="#FNanchor_624" class="label">[624]</a> Another instance where a white woman was received by a
man as his daughter and accepted into the tribe and into all her
rights and relationships, is told by Macgillivray, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, i., p. 303.
She was shipwrecked, came into the power of the natives, and, of
course, lived in a very miserable condition. Her only comfort
was derived from the man who imagined that she was his reborn
daughter. Henderson says that among the blacks of New South
Wales the belief in white men being dead relatives who had
returned was quite general. Such white men were accepted into
the tribe and cordially treated. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Loc. cit.</i>, p. 161.</p>

<p>For other statements about white men being reincarnated dead
relatives see Wilhelmi, <cite>Trans. R.S.V.</cite>, v. p. 189. Br. Smyth, <cite>Aborigines

but his conclusion, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"l'enfant-esprit qui se réincarne est déjà dans
une relation determinée avec le père et la mère qui lui donnent
naissance,"</span> is nearly identical with what we have endeavoured to
prove here. Perhaps the word "relation" does not quite coincide
with what we are especially concerned with in this place, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i>
individual kinship, and has a wider, more general meaning.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_665" id="Footnote_665" href="#FNanchor_665" class="label">[665]</a> It is very important to note that this individual rearing is,
in all probability, deeply connected with the aboriginal mode
of life; viz. their scattered manner of living in small groups and
their roaming habits. Both these latter seem to be, on the other
hand, dependent upon the economic conditions of the stage of
primitive hunting and fishing, and it may be assumed that all
lower races have passed through, broadly speaking, the same
circumstances of life; it is, therefore, probable that the fact of
common nursing can never have taken place in very low societies.
I do not think, consequently, that Dr. Rivers's hypothesis, basing
group motherhood on communism in suckling and rearing, can
be accepted even in its general form.</p></div>

with the question whether there is group relationship between
parents and children in the tribes where the Pirrauru custom
prevails, and it was found that the assumption of its existence must
be absolutely discarded, and that everywhere there is individual

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_951" id="Footnote_951" href="#FNanchor_951" class="label">[951]</a> Prof. Durkheim has pointed out (<cite>D. Tr. S.</cite>, pp. 19 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>) that
the division of social functions has a most important share in
creating the unity of a given group, and amongst other things
in creating the solidarity of marriage: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"C'est la division du
travail sexuel qui est la source de la solidarité conjugal"</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>,
p. 19). This view is fully appreciated in the present study where
the sexual division of functions is represented as being of foremost
importance in defining individual family and marriage in
Australia. But Prof. Durkheim says that in low or primitive
societies division of sexual labour and conjugal solidarity are
both quite rudimentary: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"plus nous remontons dans le passé,
plus elle se réduit à peu de chose"</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 20). The same
applies to the persistence of marriage&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"la solidarité conjugale y
est même très faible"</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 22). If Prof. Durkheim applies
both his assertions to hypothetical prehistoric societies, then this is
not the place to discuss his views. But if he has had before his
mind actually existing primitive societies, then the evidence here
collected, on both these points, might possibly compel him to
discuss his views more in detail, as far as the Australian society
is concerned. Prof. Durkheim lays the stress of his argument
on the small sexual differentiation in respect to physiology and
anatomy of primitive and prehistoric men and women. But
sexual division of labour may have as well <em>social</em> as <em>physiological</em>
sources, as shown above.</p></div>

<em>essential</em> constituents of the family. Besides, there cannot exist
a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"communauté de fait"</span>; a social group cannot exist without the
sanction of the surrounding society, and this creates obligations
between the members of the group.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_964" id="Footnote_964" href="#FNanchor_964" class="label">[964]</a> We obviously cannot agree with Prof. Durkheim when he
says further (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, p. 331), speaking of the Australian family:
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Ce sont des associations de fait, non de droit. Elles dépendent
du gré des particuliers, se forment comme elles veulent, sans
être tenues de s'astreindre à aucune norme préalable."</span> The
Australian family is not a casual but a legal association, for it
does not depend upon the whim of individuals; neither is it
formed when and how they choose. There are norms governing
its formation, duties and obligations while it lasts, and even
afterwards when it has been dissolved by a natural cause, such
as the death of the husband. All these norms, duties and
obligations are legal (compare the definition of legal, <a href="#Pg11">p. 11</a>),
for non-compliance with them leads to the interference of society;
and they directly show that society approves of this institution.
The reasoning of Prof. Durkheim&mdash;who enumerates four domestic
rights and obligations (vendette, law of inheritance, name and
cult), and says that those four functions are attached to the
<em>clan</em>&mdash;is open to very serious objections. In the first place it is
dubious whether those four duties constitute the main body of
primitive domestic law. The economic functions, the duties
and rules of cohabitation, the various duties towards children,
the mourning duties of religious character&mdash;all these legal functions,
which are domestic rights and obligations even in our
society, were shown to exist in Australia. They belong to the
family and not to the clan. On the other hand, when revenge
is to be taken on members of another local group, then it is the
local group offended which carries it out. The cases of intergroup
justice are very few, for evil magic is always looked for at
a distance, and we have hardly any information about justice
within the local group. (For all particulars compare Wheeler,
chap. viii. pp. 116 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sqq.</i>) It is not the clan, but the local group
about which we know most in this respect. Inheritance, owing
to the unimportance of private property (compare Wheeler,
p. 36) plays a very subordinate rôle. From the six instances
collected by Wheeler (pp. 37, 38), three point to inheritance
according to class, three to inheritance according to family.
Land was not a clan property, as we saw. There remains of Prof.
Durkheim's legal customs the name and the cult. Cult may be
obviously as well a public as a domestic institution; the name is
not enough to show that the clan was the only legal form of family.</p></div>
